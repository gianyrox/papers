# A Stablecoin Utopia

It's a Tuesday morning. Four cities. Four people. They don't know each other. They never will. But right now, at this exact moment, they share the same invisible infrastructure — like strangers on different continents breathing the same atmosphere.

In Bogota, Colombia, Pablo Toro finishes his last delivery of the morning and pulls his motorcycle to the curb. The engine ticks as it cools. He opens an app on his cracked phone screen and taps a few buttons. Two hundred thousand Colombian pesos convert to USDT.\[^1\] He types in his mother's wallet address in Caracas, Venezuela — he knows it by heart now — and hits send.

Three seconds. A green checkmark.

He stares at it for a moment, the way you stare at something you still don't fully believe. Then his phone buzzes. A WhatsApp message from his mother: *Llegó, mijo.*

It arrived, son.

The whole thing took ninety seconds. No Western Union line. No 7% fee. No week of wondering. His mother will buy medicine today, not next Thursday. Pablo puts his phone in his pocket, kicks the motorcycle to life, and pulls back into traffic.

Two years ago, Pablo sent money through Western Union. The fee was $14 on a $200 transfer. The money took five days. His mother went to the office twice before they said it had arrived. There was no green checkmark. There was silence, and then worry, and then relief — if it came at all.

The first time the stablecoin transfer worked, Pablo didn't celebrate. He cried. Because for years, he'd spent a week not knowing if the money that his mother needed for medicine had made it through six institutions, each one indifferent to her urgency.\[^2\]

Sending $200 to his mother now costs less than $2 and takes less time than ordering coffee. The fact that this feels miraculous tells you everything about the system it replaced.

Six thousand miles east, in a living room in Harare, Zimbabwe, Mercy Musodzi is counting money. Not paper money — numbers on a screen. She sits in a circle of eleven women on plastic chairs, a notebook open on her lap. This is the monthly meeting of their savings club.\[^3\] Each woman has contributed her share. The pot sits in Mercy's phone, denominated in cUSD on the Celo blockchain.

She doesn't call it that. She calls it "the digital dollar."

Last year, they pooled their savings in Zimbabwean dollars. By the time the last woman's turn came around, inflation had eaten 56% of the value.\[^4\] Six months of discipline, halved. Women who had skipped meals to contribute watched their sacrifice evaporate.

This year, Mercy converts the pot the day it comes in. She opens her phone, taps through the conversion, and the money sits in digital dollars until the recipient needs it. When she cashes out for the current beneficiary, the value is exactly what went in.

"We're not helpless against inflation now," she told the group the first time it worked.\[^5\]

The women nodded, slowly. Some of them didn't fully understand the technology. All of them understood the result.

What happened in that living room — whether Mercy knows it or not — is a textbook case of how trust forms when institutions have repeatedly failed. The process follows a cycle: someone recommends it. You test it with a small amount. It works. You try a larger amount. It works again. The behavior normalizes. Others in the community ask how to do it too.\[^6\]

Mercy's savings club walked through every stage of that cycle. The nervousness at the start. The small test. The held breath while waiting to see if the value held. And then the quiet exhale when it did.

This is how trust is built in a world where the old institutions broke their promises. Not through branding or regulation or government endorsement — through function. The money held its value. That was enough.

In Lagos, Nigeria, the man who calls himself Femi — not his real name, but the one he gave the researchers from Cambridge\[^7\] — is sitting in the back of a parked car, laptop balanced on his knees, generator humming somewhere behind the building. He's about to send $100,000 to a supplier in Shenzhen, China.

A month ago, he tried to do this through his bank. They gave him $10,000 of the $100,000 he'd requested in foreign exchange. "Source the rest on the black market," they told him. He'd done it before — the desperate dance of parallel rates, bureau de change runners, and physical cash. Painful. Dangerous. Slow.

Today he opens Binance, navigates to the P2P marketplace, and converts 75 million naira\[^8\] to USDT. He copies his supplier's Tron wallet address from a WeChat message, pastes it, and sends.

Twenty minutes. One dollar in fees.

His supplier in Shenzhen will confirm receipt within the hour. The shipment of phone accessories will be on a container ship by Friday. Femi closes his laptop and steps out of the car into Lagos heat that hits like a wall.

He doesn't think of himself as a crypto enthusiast. He thinks of himself as a businessman who found a door that was always locked and then just... opened.

No bank approved this transaction. No compliance officer reviewed it. No correspondent banking chain touched it. Femi needed dollars, his bank couldn't provide them, and a public blockchain did — in twenty minutes, for a dollar, with no one's permission.

The global financial system is built on the assumption that identity and institutional approval are prerequisites for moving money. Femi's transaction exists because that assumption fails — reliably, routinely, and at scale — for hundreds of millions of people.

And in her apartment somewhere in the United States, Mika Reyes opens her Phantom wallet on Solana and sees it: 3,200 USDC\[^9\] from a design client in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. It arrived while she was sleeping. No email notification from PayPal about a hold. No 3-5 business day processing window. No 4-6% eaten by FX markups and service fees. Just... the money. Sitting in her wallet. Hers.

She was floored the first time this happened. Genuinely astonished. Not at the technology — she'd been around Web3 for years. But at the *feeling*. The feeling of money arriving the way a text message arrives. Instant. Complete. No intermediary standing between her work and her payment with their hand out.

"I was struck by the potential of stablecoins to move money instantly across borders without high costs or long waits."\[^10\]

On the shelf behind her laptop, there's an old notebook. Cramped handwriting. Columns of numbers with names and dates. Her father's handwriting. For years, her family tracked money moving between the US and the Philippines in this notebook — a handwritten ledger of IOUs, because bank transfers were too slow, too expensive, and too unreliable to trust without a paper backup.

That notebook is why she built Parallax.\[^11\] A stablecoin payroll platform. So no freelancer would have to keep a ledger like that again.

Mika didn't wait for the banking system to fix itself. She didn't wait for someone to give her permission. She experienced the problem, found the tool, and turned it into infrastructure for others. She's not just using the new architecture. She's building it.

Four people. Four cities. A delivery driver, a savings club leader, an importer, a designer. None of them would describe what they do as "using cryptocurrency." Pablo calls it "the app." Mercy calls it "the digital dollar." Femi calls it "the transfer." Mika calls it "getting paid."

They are already living in the future.

## The Psychology of Trust

So how does a Nigerian businessman trust Tether — a company he's never heard of, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, that has never completed a full audit — more than his own bank?

How does a Zimbabwean savings club leader put her community's money into a digital token on a blockchain she can't explain?

The answer cuts to the core of what this book is about: trust in the 21st century is earned through function, not authority.\[^12\]

Daniel Kahneman's research on loss aversion\[^13\] explains why inflation-ravaged populations adopt stablecoins faster than anyone else. The pain of losing 50% of your savings to inflation is psychologically stronger than the comfort of staying with a familiar bank. When the familiar institution has already failed you — when the naira has already lost 40%, when the bolivar is already worthless — the risk of trying something new is lower than the risk of doing nothing.

Behavioral economists call this "prospect theory" — people evaluate gains and losses relative to a reference point.\[^14\] The reference point for Mercy's savings club isn't a theoretical ideal. It's last year, when inflation ate 56% of their pooled money. Against that reference point, converting to an unfamiliar digital dollar isn't risky. It's the rational choice.

And there's the "default effect" — when stablecoin wallets come pre-loaded in fintech apps, or when a community leader like Mercy introduces the conversion as the group's standard practice, adoption becomes frictionless. The path of least resistance shifts.\[^15\]

The trust formation cycle that played out in Mercy's living room — peer recommendation, small test, incremental increase, normalized behavior, community adoption — is the same cycle that drove M-Pesa adoption in Kenya, mobile banking adoption in South Asia, and credit card adoption in the 1960s. New financial technology always starts with someone nervous about pressing the wrong button. It succeeds when the first experience works.

This cycle is the thread that runs through every chapter of this book. In Chapter 3, you'll see it at national scale — entire countries moving through the stages. In Chapter 5, you'll see what happens when the cycle breaks — when the first experience DOESN'T work, and trust collapses overnight.

The trust question is the defining question. Stablecoins are not asking you to trust a bank. They're not asking you to trust a government. They're asking you to trust a mechanism — cryptographic verification, public ledger transparency, dollar-denominated reserves, and the collective behavior of millions of other users. Whether that mechanism deserves trust is what this book spends five chapters examining.

## The Number

The stablecoin market processed $27.6 trillion in on-chain volume in 2024.\[^16\]

Pause on that.

$27.6 trillion. That's more than Visa and Mastercard combined — by 7.7%.\[^17\] Not a theoretical projection. Actual value, moving on blockchain rails, between real people and real businesses, in every time zone, every day.

By late 2025, annual stablecoin volume exceeded $50 trillion.\[^18\]

Pablo's $200 transfer to Caracas is in there. Femi's $100,000 to Shenzhen is in there. Mercy's savings club conversion is in there. Mika's 3,200 USDC from Amsterdam is in there.

So is a massive amount of crypto trading volume — which Chapter 5 addresses honestly. But the real-economy share is growing, and the total volume dwarfs any alternative measurement of how fast a new financial system has ever scaled.

## The Bet

Here's this book's bet, stated plainly so you can hold us to it:

By 2035, three billion people will hold stablecoins as their primary savings vehicle, and the word "crypto" will have disappeared from the conversation — just as nobody calls email "internet mail" anymore.\[^19\] Stablecoins won't be a technology category. They'll just be money.

What would prove that bet wrong?

A catastrophic collapse of Tether with no recovery. A coordinated G7 ban. A technological breakthrough that makes blockchain obsolete. Or central bank digital currencies succeeding so completely that private stablecoins become redundant.

Every one of those possibilities gets examined honestly in this book. The failures — and there have been spectacular ones — are given the same weight as the successes. The strongest critics get the strongest versions of their arguments. The uncomfortable questions don't get dodged.

But first, we need to understand what's broken. Because the future that Pablo, Mercy, Femi, and Mika are living in only feels miraculous because the present — the way money actually works for most people on Earth — is so broken that most of us have stopped noticing.

It's time to see the broken thing clearly.
