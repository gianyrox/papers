# A Stablecoin Utopia

It's a Tuesday morning. Four cities. Four people. They don't know each other. They never will. But right now, at this exact moment, they share the same invisible infrastructure — like strangers on different continents breathing the same atmosphere.

In Bogota, Pablo Toro finishes his last delivery of the morning and pulls his motorcycle to the curb. The engine ticks as it cools. He opens an app on his cracked phone screen and taps a few buttons. Two hundred thousand Colombian pesos convert to USDT. He types in his mother's wallet address in Caracas — he knows it by heart now — and hits send.

Three seconds. A green checkmark.

He stares at it for a moment, the way you stare at something you still don't fully believe. Then his phone buzzes. A WhatsApp message from his mother: *Llegó, mijo.*

It arrived, son.

The whole thing took ninety seconds. No Western Union line. No 7% fee. No week of wondering. His mother will buy medicine today, not next Thursday. Pablo puts his phone in his pocket, kicks the motorcycle to life, and pulls back into traffic.

Six thousand miles east, in a living room in Harare, Mercy Musodzi is counting money. Not paper money — numbers on a screen. She sits in a circle of eleven women on plastic chairs, a notebook open on her lap. This is the monthly meeting of their savings club. Each woman has contributed her share. The pot sits in Mercy's phone, denominated in cUSD on the Celo blockchain.

She doesn't call it that. She calls it "the digital dollar."

Last year, they pooled their savings in Zimbabwean dollars. By the time the last woman's turn came around, inflation had eaten 56% of the value. Six months of discipline, halved. Women who had skipped meals to contribute watched their sacrifice evaporate.

This year, Mercy converts the pot the day it comes in. She opens her phone, taps through the conversion, and the money sits in digital dollars until the recipient needs it. When she cashes out for the current beneficiary, the value is exactly what went in.

"We're not helpless against inflation now," she told the group the first time it worked. The women nodded, slowly. Some of them didn't fully understand the technology. All of them understood the result.

In Lagos, the man who calls himself Femi — not his real name, but the one he gave the researchers from Cambridge — is sitting in the back of a parked car, laptop balanced on his knees, generator humming somewhere behind the building. He's about to send $100,000 to a supplier in Shenzhen.

A month ago, he tried to do this through his bank. They gave him $10,000 of the $100,000 he'd requested in foreign exchange. "Source the rest on the black market," they told him. He'd done it before — the desperate dance of parallel rates, bureau de change runners, and physical cash. Painful. Dangerous. Slow.

Today he opens Binance, navigates to the P2P marketplace, and converts 75 million naira to USDT. He copies his supplier's Tron wallet address from a WeChat message, pastes it, and sends.

Twenty minutes. One dollar in fees.

His supplier in Shenzhen will confirm receipt within the hour. The shipment of phone accessories will be on a container ship by Friday. Femi closes his laptop and steps out of the car into Lagos heat that hits like a wall.

He doesn't think of himself as a crypto enthusiast. He thinks of himself as a businessman who found a door that was always locked and then just... opened.

And in her apartment somewhere in the United States, Mika Reyes opens her Phantom wallet on Solana and sees it: 3,200 USDC from a design client in Amsterdam. It arrived while she was sleeping. No email notification from PayPal about a hold. No 3-5 business day processing window. No 4-6% eaten by FX markups and service fees. Just... the money. Sitting in her wallet. Hers.

She was floored the first time this happened. Genuinely astonished. Not at the technology — she'd been around Web3 for years. But at the *feeling*. The feeling of money arriving the way a text message arrives. Instant. Complete. No intermediary standing between her work and her payment with their hand out.

On the shelf behind her laptop, there's an old notebook. Cramped handwriting. Columns of numbers with names and dates. Her father's handwriting. For years, her family tracked money moving between the US and the Philippines in this notebook — a handwritten ledger of IOUs, because bank transfers were too slow, too expensive, and too unreliable to trust without a paper backup.

That notebook is why she built Parallax. A stablecoin payroll platform. So no freelancer would have to keep a ledger like that again.

Four people. Four cities. A delivery driver, a savings club leader, an importer, a designer. None of them would describe what they do as "using cryptocurrency." Pablo calls it "the app." Mercy calls it "the digital dollar." Femi calls it "the transfer." Mika calls it "getting paid."

They are already living in the future.

The rest of this book is about why that future exists, how it works, who's building it, what could go wrong, and why — if you're reading this — it's probably coming for your money too.

But first, let's dream a little bigger.

## The Dream

Imagine a world where money moves like information.

Where sending $500 across the planet costs the same as sending a text message and takes just as long. Where a nurse in Manila gets paid the second her shift ends, not five days later minus fees. Where a farmer in Kenya sells coffee to a roaster in Portland and gets paid before the shipment lands.

Imagine a refugee crossing a border with her life savings on a phone, not sewn into a jacket lining. A teenager in Nairobi launching a business and receiving her first payment from a customer in Tokyo — no merchant account, no bank approval, no payment processor deciding whether she's worthy. She just... receives money. A gig worker finishing a job at 11pm on a Sunday and having the money on his phone before he goes to sleep.

Imagine a world where your government can't inflate away your savings because you opted into a global dollar from your couch. Where a small NGO in Sudan distributes relief funds directly to families in minutes, every dollar traceable, zero lost to intermediaries or corruption.

24/7. Borderless. Instant. Near-free. Permissionless.

No banking hours. No correspondent chains. No Western Union taking 7%. No five-day settlement window because the computers that run the global banking system still take weekends off like it's 1973.

In this world, financial inclusion isn't a charity program or a government initiative. It's the default architecture. The system itself includes everyone, not because someone decided to be generous, but because exclusion requires more effort than inclusion on an open network.

Instead of thousands of fragmented private ledgers — each bank maintaining its own version of who has what, each requiring permission to access — there's one shared ledger. Global. Transparent. Always on.

And here's the thing that makes all of this possible, the core conceptual move that the rest of this book unpacks: the money isn't new. The dollar is the same dollar. The innovation is the ledger it lives on. That's it. Existing money, moved from private bank databases to a shared, programmable, global ledger. One architectural change. Everything else follows.

You can think of a stablecoin as a digital dollar that moves like a text message. Same dollar. New rails.

So what about identity? In this world, buying a coffee doesn't require handing over your identity. But buying a house does. You choose when to prove who you are. Money works like cash again — but better. Private by default, transparent when it needs to be.

And what about participation? Anyone can receive money. Anyone can send money. Anyone can become a business. The rails don't ask permission. The rails don't care who you are, where you live, or whether a bank has decided you're worth serving. Participation is the default.

This probably sounds like a fantasy. Maybe it sounds too good to be true. Maybe you're thinking about the last time someone tried to sell you on a crypto revolution and it ended with someone losing their life savings and a founder fleeing to Montenegro.

Fair enough. Healthy skepticism is the right instinct. This book will earn your trust, not demand it.

But here's the question that frames everything that follows: what if this wasn't a dream? What if this was already happening?

What if Pablo, Mercy, Femi, and Mika weren't hypothetical? What if they were real people, using real technology, moving real money, right now — and what if the system they're using was growing faster than Visa?

Because they are. And it is.

The stablecoin market processed $27.6 trillion in on-chain volume in 2024. That's more than Visa and Mastercard combined. Not a theoretical projection — actual value, moving on blockchain rails, between real people and real businesses, in every time zone, every day.

And here's this book's bet, stated plainly so you can hold us to it: by 2035, three billion people will hold stablecoins as their primary savings vehicle, and the word "crypto" will have disappeared from the conversation — just as nobody calls email "internet mail" anymore. Stablecoins won't be a technology category. They'll just be money.

What would prove that bet wrong? A catastrophic collapse of Tether with no recovery. A coordinated G7 ban. A technological breakthrough that makes blockchain obsolete. Or central bank digital currencies succeeding so completely that private stablecoins become redundant.

We'll examine every one of those possibilities honestly in this book. We'll walk through the failures — and there have been spectacular ones. We'll give the strongest critics the strongest versions of their arguments and engage with them directly.

But first, we need to understand what's broken. Because the dream in this chapter only feels dreamlike because the reality of how money works today is so absurd that we've normalized it. We've accepted five-day settlement times the way people in the 1990s accepted dial-up internet — not because it was good, but because we didn't know anything else.

It's time to see the broken thing clearly.
