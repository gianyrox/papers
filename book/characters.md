## Femi — Nigerian Electronics Importer

**Who he is:** Mid-30s, Lagos-based entrepreneur. Imports phone accessories and consumer electronics from Shenzhen. Self-made, sharp, impatient with systems that waste his time. Grew up watching his father navigate the same broken banking infrastructure and swore he'd find a way around it.

**Speech patterns:** Direct, clipped sentences when talking business. Switches between English and Pidgin naturally. Uses numbers to make his points — he thinks in margins, percentages, exchange rates. When he's frustrated, he gets quiet, not loud. When he describes the old system, there's a weariness in his voice — he's been fighting this fight for years. When he talks about USDT, there's a brightness, almost disbelief — like someone describing a door that was always locked and then just... opened.

**Emotional register:** Pragmatic frustration → grudging hope → earned confidence. He doesn't trust easily. He trusts results. The first time he sent $100K in USDT in 20 minutes for $1, something shifted in him — not excitement, but recognition. This is how it should have always worked.

**Sensory details:** The glow of his phone screen in a Lagos traffic jam, the hum of generators in his neighborhood, the weight of his laptop bag as he walks into a cafe to make a transfer that used to require a month of begging his bank. The smell of new electronics still in their packaging, shipped from Shenzhen because he figured out how to pay for them.

**What he sounds like:** "I spent one month trying. One month. The bank gave me $10,000 of the $100,000 I needed. They told me to source the rest on the black market. So I did — but not the way they expected." / "I trust the dollar stablecoin more than the naira in my bank. I don't know who runs Tether, but I know the dollar it represents is stable."

## Pablo Toro — Venezuelan Delivery Driver in Bogota

**Who he is:** Late 20s, former security guard in Caracas who left Venezuela when the economy collapsed. Works as a delivery driver in Bogota. Sends money home to his mother and younger sister every week. The remittance is not optional — it's medicine, food, electricity when there is electricity.

**Speech patterns:** Speaks softly, with care. Chooses words deliberately, especially about money — because every word about money carries the weight of his family's survival. When he talks about the old system (Western Union, bank transfers), there's a tightness — controlled anger. When he talks about sending money via his crypto app, his voice loosens. Relief, not excitement. He doesn't evangelize. He just does it.

**Emotional register:** Quiet desperation → cautious relief → protective vigilance. He worries constantly. Even when the system works, he checks. He checks again. The first time his mother texted him five minutes after a transfer — confirming she received it — he didn't celebrate. He cried. Because for years, he'd spend a week not knowing if the money made it.

**Sensory details:** The buzz of his phone with a delivery notification in Bogota traffic. The cracked screen he can't afford to replace. The Valiu app open on his phone at night, the green confirmation checkmark. His mother's voice on a WhatsApp call — staticky, because the power in Caracas flickers. The 7% that Western Union used to take, which he can now describe to the centavo.

**What he sounds like:** "When the power is out in Venezuela, when internet service is down, it has a huge impact on how long it takes to send a remittance. Now I don't have to worry." / "Before, I would send the money and then... nothing. For days. My mother would go to Western Union and sometimes they would say it hadn't arrived. I couldn't sleep those nights."

## Mercy Musodzi — Zimbabwean Women's Savings Club Leader

**Who she is:** Early 40s, lives in Harare. Leads a women's savings club — a rotating credit group where members pool money monthly and take turns receiving the pot. She's the one the other women trust to hold the numbers. She's precise, community-minded, and fiercely protective of the group's money. When Zimbabwe's 56% inflation started eating their pooled savings, she went looking for a solution. She found Celo.

**Speech patterns:** Measured, educational. She explains things clearly because she's been explaining financial concepts to women with little formal education for years. She doesn't use jargon — she translates everything into what it means for the group. When she talks about inflation, it's personal — she watched their collective work evaporate. When she talks about cUSD, there's quiet pride. She figured this out. She taught the others.

**Emotional register:** Protective determination → methodical problem-solving → communal pride. She doesn't feel individual triumph — she feels the group's success. When the club cashed out after six months and their money had held its value while everyone else's savings had halved, the feeling wasn't "I was right." It was "We're safe."

**Sensory details:** The circle of women sitting on plastic chairs in someone's living room in Harare. The notebook where she records each contribution in careful handwriting. The cheap Android phone she uses to convert funds to cUSD — her fingers are deliberate on the screen, not fast. The sound of women discussing whether to trust this new thing, and Mercy's calm voice cutting through the doubt. The relief on their faces when the numbers hold.

**What she sounds like:** "By converting our pooled funds into stablecoins, we hedge against value loss. The women were nervous at first — they had heard of scams. I showed them, step by step. After six months, they saw the result." / "We're not helpless against inflation now."

## Mika Reyes — UX Designer & Startup Founder, USA/Philippines

**Who she is:** Late 20s, UX designer based in the US with deep roots in the Philippines. Freelanced for international clients across Europe and Asia. Grew up watching her father track money between the US and Philippines on a handwritten ledger of IOUs because bank transfers were too painful and expensive. That ledger is the image that drives everything she builds. She co-founded Parallax, a stablecoin payroll platform, after experiencing USDC payments firsthand.

**Speech patterns:** Energetic, clear, slightly technical but always translating. She's a designer — she thinks in user experience, friction points, flows. When she describes the old payment system, she sounds exasperated — like a designer looking at a terrible interface. When she describes receiving her first USDC payment, there's genuine wonder. She uses the word "floored." She's the character who bridges the technical and the human — she understands the code AND why it matters to her dad.

**Emotional register:** Frustrated pragmatism → genuine astonishment → builder's conviction. She didn't come to stablecoins through ideology or investment. She came through pain — the pain of watching PayPal take a cut, of waiting 3-5 days for a wire, of keeping that damn ledger. When USDC arrived in her Phantom wallet in seconds from a European client, something clicked. Not just "this is better." But "this is what it should have always been." And then: "I'm going to build this for everyone."

**Sensory details:** Her apartment, laptop open, Phantom wallet on one tab, a Figma project on another. The notification ping when USDC arrives — instant, no waiting. The old notebook her father kept, cramped handwriting tracking who owed whom across oceans. The contrast between that notebook and the Parallax dashboard she designed. Coffee shops in Manila where she met with developers. The loading screen of a wire transfer she'll never see again.

**What she sounds like:** "I was floored at how quickly it arrived from my client in Europe. No fees, no waiting, no calling the bank to ask where my money was." / "My dad and I literally kept a handwritten ledger of IOUs between the US and Philippines. That's how bad it was. That notebook is why I started Parallax." / "This method quickly became essential for my freelance work. I was struck by the potential of stablecoins to move money instantly across borders without high costs or long waits."
