## The Steel-Manned Case Against Stablecoins

These are the best arguments from the smartest critics, stated at their strongest. The book's credibility depends on engaging with them honestly, not dismissing them.

### "This Is Dollar Imperialism With Better UX"

99%+ of stablecoins are USD-pegged. When a Nigerian farmer saves in USDT instead of naira, he makes a rational individual choice. But collectively, millions doing this is de facto dollarization. The IMF warns it strips developing nations of monetary sovereignty, seigniorage revenue, and the ability to respond to local economic shocks. When the Fed raises rates, the whole world feels it through stablecoins now, not just through trade channels.

Non-USD stablecoins are less than 1% of the market and show no sign of catching up. The Eurodollar parallel is instructive — Eurodollars reinforced dollar dominance, and the consequences played out over decades in ways nobody predicted. If stablecoins lock in dollar dominance for another century, countries that adopted them for short-term stability may regret the long-term dependency.

The honest response: the alternative for people in 100%+ inflation countries isn't "preserve monetary sovereignty." It's "watch savings evaporate." This is a genuine tension without a clean resolution.

### "If They Can Freeze Your Money, This Isn't Freedom"

Circle and Tether have frozen 800+ addresses. Your "self-custodied" USDC can be rendered worthless with one smart contract call. In what sense is this different from a bank freezing your account? You've traded one centralized authority for another — one subject to your local law, the other subject to US law you have no voice in.

The centralization is structural, not incidental. Fiat-backed stablecoins REQUIRE a centralized issuer who holds reserves and can freeze tokens. Decentralized alternatives have catastrophically failed. So the choice is: centralized stablecoin that can freeze you, or decentralized stablecoin that might collapse to zero.

The honest response: stablecoins offer a spectrum. DAI exists as a decentralized option that hasn't collapsed. ZK compliance is emerging. And even centralized stablecoins offer improvements over banking: 24/7 access, no minimum balance, no credit check, global portability. For the 1.4 billion unbanked who can't even GET a bank account to freeze, this is still a massive upgrade. The question is whether the ecosystem moves toward more privacy-preserving designs over time.

### "The Truly Unbanked Can't Use This"

Stablecoins require a smartphone, internet access, and enough technical literacy to manage a wallet. The "1.4 billion unbanked" includes many people who lack not just a bank account but reliable internet, a smartphone, or digital literacy. MoneyGram's 180-country agent network is real but thin in rural areas. Brazil's 24,000 ATMs are concentrated in cities. The deepest poverty is correlated with the least digital access.

The honest response: this is valid today, but smartphone penetration in Sub-Saharan Africa grows roughly 10% annually. M-Pesa IS integrating stablecoins across 8 countries, bringing its existing agent network to bear. The same pattern happened with mobile money itself — urban first, then rural as demand proved the business model. Stablecoins don't have to reach everyone to be transformative. If they reach the 2-3 billion who have smartphones but don't have good banking, that's already a paradigm shift.

### "DeFi Yields Are Just Rehypothecated Risk"

Anchor Protocol offered 20% APY and attracted $18 billion. It was a Ponzi. Celsius offered 8-18% and was lending recklessly. BlockFi, Voyager — all collapsed. The pattern: stablecoin yield products attract depositors with unsustainable rates, use funds for risky bets, and blow up. Even "legitimate" DeFi yields come from leverage — someone is borrowing at 5-10% to speculate, and when the music stops, liquidation cascades follow.

The honest response: the distinction between CeFi yield products (Celsius, BlockFi) and DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Maker) matters enormously. CeFi collapsed because it was opaque, under-collateralized, and run by humans making bad bets. DeFi protocols survived because they're transparent, over-collateralized, and enforce rules via code. MakerDAO navigated a 70% price crash with zero bailouts. The lesson isn't "yield is bad" — it's "opaque, under-collateralized yield is bad."

### "This Recreates the Same Power Structures"

Tether earns $10 billion a year from the float — seigniorage that used to flow to governments. Circle, backed by BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, is the other dominant issuer. The "decentralized" stablecoin ecosystem is controlled by two companies, backed by Wall Street. If Visa, Stripe, and PayPal are the on-ramps and JP Morgan is the custodian, you've rebuilt the banking system with extra steps and fewer consumer protections.

The honest response: this may be the most uncomfortable argument because it contains real truth. The short-term trajectory IS toward institutional capture. But two things are different: the rails are open — anyone can build on them without permission. A Nigerian fintech can plug into USDC without getting a banking charter from four countries. And the competition is global with lower barriers to entry. Will power consolidate? Probably. But in a more contestable way than traditional banking.

### "Most of That Volume Is Crypto Trading, Not the Real Economy"

An estimated 88% of stablecoin transactions in 2024 were for crypto trading, not real-world commerce. Traders moving USDT between exchanges to arbitrage. DeFi protocols recycling capital through lending loops. Market makers minting and redeeming. Strip out the trading volume and the "real economy" stablecoin usage is a fraction of the headline $27.6 trillion.

The honest response: the snapshot is accurate but the trend line matters. The 88% trading share was higher in 2021-22. It's declining as real-world use cases grow. SMB usage doubled from 17% to 34% between 2024-25. The parallel: early internet traffic was overwhelmingly academic/military before commercial use exploded. The infrastructure gets built for one use case and adopted for others. But the book should be honest that today, most stablecoin volume is financial plumbing, not Pablo sending money to Caracas.

### "This Runs on 5% Treasury Yields — What Happens When Rates Drop?"

Tether earned $13 billion+ in 2024. These profits are entirely a product of 5%+ Treasury yields. At 0.5% yields — where we were from 2009 to 2021 — Tether's profit drops to roughly $1.3 billion, barely enough to cover operations. The VC interest, the new entrants, the institutional enthusiasm — all catalyzed by a specific interest rate environment that is cyclical, not permanent.

The honest response: the yield bonanza accelerated adoption but didn't create the use cases. Nigerian traders using USDT to pay Chinese suppliers don't care about Tether's yield. Pablo's remittances work at any interest rate. The fundamental draw — instant, borderless, permissionless money movement — is rate-independent. What IS rate-dependent: issuer profitability, yield product attractiveness, and the pace of institutional entry. Lower rates slow the business side but don't reverse the usage side. The risk is that lower rates cause issuers to cut corners.

---

Seven arguments. None of them are easy to dismiss. This book's thesis survives them — but only if we engage honestly with each one, and only if the reader is trusted to weigh the evidence and decide for themselves.
