## The Convergence: Who's Building This and Why Now

In 2024, stablecoins processed $27.6 trillion in on-chain volume. That's more than Visa and Mastercard combined — by 7.7%.[^1] By late 2025, annual volumes exceeded $50 trillion.[^2] PayPal's entire 2024 payment volume was less than 5% of stablecoin volume.

This is no longer a crypto-native phenomenon. The biggest financial institutions on Earth are in. And they're in because five specific structural forces converged between 2024 and 2026 to create an inflection point that none of them could ignore.

### Force 1: The Rules Finally Arrived

After years of regulatory ambiguity, stablecoin rules crystallized across the world's major economies — nearly simultaneously.

The EU's MiCA framework took effect in mid-2024.[^3] Japan amended its Payment Services Act in 2023. The UAE's VARA launched in June 2024. Hong Kong's licensing regime went live in 2025. Singapore tightened reserve requirements under MAS.

And in June 2025, the United States passed the GENIUS Act — the first federal law regulating payment stablecoins. Full reserves in approved assets. Monthly attestations. Clear redemption rights. Three pathways: federal OCC license, state license, or compliant foreign issuer. Unlicensed issuance becomes illegal.[^4]

Former CFTC Chair Giancarlo: "There was no familiarity with stablecoins in 2019. Now there's been extensive public work and lobbying. The world has changed."[^5]

Rules turned stablecoins from a Wild West experiment into a governed financial product. Large institutions won't enter without regulatory clarity — and now they have it.

### Force 2: The Survivors Got Stronger

Terra collapsed in May 2022. $40 billion vaporized. FTX imploded in November. Celsius froze withdrawals. The crypto credit crisis wiped out billions in retail savings.

The surviving stablecoins got stronger. Tether eliminated all commercial paper by end-2022 and moved to US Treasury bills. Circle published daily reserve reports. The market consolidated around "fully backed" as the winning design.[^6]

USDC survived its own stress test: when Silicon Valley Bank collapsed in March 2023, Circle had $3.3 billion stuck there. USDC dropped to $0.87. Within 72 hours, after the FDIC backstopped deposits, it recovered to $1.00.[^7] The market interpreted this not as a failure but as a stress test passed.

By 2024, stablecoin users were battle-tested and more discerning. The narrative shifted from "are stablecoins safe?" to "stablecoins proved their worth in the storm."

### Force 3: Interest Rates Changed Everything

5% Treasury yields transformed the economics of stablecoin issuance overnight.

Tether earned $6.2 billion in profit in 2023.[^8] To put that in context: Tether operates with approximately 100 employees. Morgan Stanley's entire workforce of roughly 80,000 people generated $8.5 billion in net income that same year.[^9] One hundred people producing returns that rival a global investment bank with 80,000. The efficiency gap tells you everything about how stablecoin economics work — the float on reserves, earned at scale, with minimal overhead.

Circle pulled in $1.7 billion in revenue.[^10] The total industry earned over $10 billion annually from reserve interest alone.

This profitability attracted new entrants. PayPal launched PYUSD. Visa expanded USDC settlement. Banks began exploring their own stablecoins. Western Union launched USDPT.

On the user side: fintech apps started passing yield to users. Turks and Brazilians earning 4-5% on dollar stablecoin deposits — a lifeline when local bank savings give negative real returns against inflation.

After a decade of near-zero rates when stablecoins had no yield advantage, the interest rate environment created an unprecedented convergence of utility plus yield.

### Force 4: The Technology Matured

Ethereum layer-2 networks — Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync — went mainstream in 2023-24.[^11] Stablecoin transfers that cost $5-20 on Ethereum's main chain now cost pennies.

Circle launched CCTP in mid-2023: USDC can "teleport" across blockchains — burn on one chain, mint on another.[^12] The liquidity fragmentation problem between Ethereum, Solana, Tron, and a dozen other networks began dissolving.

Wallets got human-readable. Usernames instead of hexadecimal addresses. Social recovery instead of seed phrases. One-click swapping between stablecoins. A Nigerian farmer can receive USDC on his phone and convert to mobile naira seamlessly — this was not possible two years earlier.

Smartphone penetration in Latin America reached 85%+ of adults by 2025.[^13] "Stablecoin as a service" APIs from Circle and Stellar let any fintech offer stablecoin wallets without building blockchain infrastructure.

The invisible adoption milestone: in 2024-2026, someone can use a stablecoin without realizing it's on a blockchain. Several Latin American neobanks use stablecoins on the backend without their customers knowing.

### Force 5: The Permission Cascade

In August 2023, PayPal launched PYUSD — the first stablecoin from a major US financial firm.[^14] There was a telling contrast: when Facebook announced Libra in 2019, a global coalition of central bankers and politicians mobilized within weeks to kill it. When PayPal launched its stablecoin, the reaction was muted.

The fear was gone. Permission had been granted.

Then the dominoes: Visa expanded USDC settlement to Solana and Ethereum, processing $3.5 billion in annualized volume by late 2023.[^15] Stripe launched stablecoin payouts in 60+ countries and made a $1 billion crypto acquisition.[^16] MoneyGram went all-in on cash-to-USDC across 180+ countries. Western Union's CEO called stablecoins "an opportunity, not a threat."[^17] Telegram integrated TON stablecoins. WhatsApp piloted stablecoin transfers. Tesla began accepting USDC.

29% of Fortune 500 executives expressed interest in stablecoins — up from 8% the year before. 90% of institutional finance was exploring stablecoin integration, according to Fireblocks.[^18]

The "permission effect": once PayPal and Visa do it, everyone else feels safe. The Fed itself opened a path in August 2023 for supervised banks to transact stablecoins for payments.

Remember the shipping container analogy from Chapter 3? Containers didn't just move goods faster. They reorganized ports, eliminated entire job categories, created new logistics industries, and shifted manufacturing to where labor was cheapest. The second-order effects were bigger than the first.

Stablecoins are doing the same. Faster payments are the first-order effect. The reorganization of banking, identity, sovereignty, and power that follows — that's the real transformation. It's already underway.

## The Rules: How Governments Tried to Stop It, Then Decided to Shape It

The regulatory story follows a clear arc: fear, attempted suppression, failed suppression, reluctant engagement, active shaping.

**2019: Facebook announces Libra.** The most powerful corporation on Earth tries to launch a global currency backed by a basket of assets. A global coalition of central bankers and politicians mobilizes in weeks. Congressional hearings. European Central Bank opposition. India threatens a ban. Libra is dead by 2022, rebranded to Diem and then shut down entirely.[^19]

But the genie is out. Every central bank now has a "stablecoin strategy."

**2022: Terra collapses.** $40 billion vaporized in days. Do Kwon flees South Korea. Interpol issues a red notice. Regulators worldwide say, "See? We told you so." But instead of banning stablecoins outright, they start writing rules.

**2023: BUSD killed overnight.** The New York Department of Financial Services orders Paxos to halt issuance of Binance's BUSD stablecoin. A $16 billion stablecoin wound down by regulatory order.[^20] The message: regulators CAN act decisively. But they chose precision, not prohibition.

**2024: MiCA takes effect.** Europe writes the first comprehensive crypto-asset regulation. Not a ban — a framework. Tether gets delisted from some EU exchanges for non-compliance. Circle rushes to register USDC. The precedent: regulate, don't eliminate.

**2025: The GENIUS Act passes.** The United States writes a federal law to integrate stablecoins into the regulated financial system. Full reserves. Monthly attestations. Redemption guarantees. Three licensing pathways. The question is no longer "should stablecoins exist?" but "what kind?"

Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle, told Congress directly: "With the right regulatory framework, stablecoins and blockchain networks could scale to support billions of users and tens of trillions of value."[^21]

The global convergence on core principles is remarkable: full backing, redemption assurance, capital requirements, transparency, licensing. The FSB's mantra — "same business, same risk, same rules" — is becoming operational reality.[^22]

What this means: the freewheeling era is ending. A bifurcation is coming — regulated stablecoins flourishing in the mainstream, unregulated ones retreating to gray markets. Legitimacy enables deeper integration with traditional finance. Banks and big fintechs adopt stablecoins when the rules are clear.

### Developing Country Approaches

The regulatory story isn't only a Western one. Developing countries are writing their own rules — and some are more innovative than the US or EU.

**Nigeria** banned crypto through banks in 2021, watched adoption accelerate through P2P channels, and reversed course. By 2025, the SEC launched a licensing framework for virtual asset service providers.[^23] The lesson learned: prohibition drives behavior underground; regulation channels it.

**India** took a taxation-first approach — imposing a 30% tax on crypto gains and a 1% TDS on transactions in 2022 — before clarifying regulatory frameworks.[^24] Usage dropped temporarily, then adapted.

**Brazil** passed a comprehensive crypto regulatory framework (Lei 14,478) in late 2022, making it one of the first Latin American countries with clear rules.[^25]

**The UAE and Singapore** are positioning as regulatory sandboxes[^26] — controlled environments where startups can test stablecoin products under supervision before full-scale launch. Dubai's VARA framework has attracted dozens of crypto firms relocating from less clear jurisdictions.

The regulatory story isn't over. There will be enforcement actions, jurisdictional conflicts, and unintended consequences. But the direction is clear: integration, not elimination. Governments tried to stop stablecoins. They failed. Now they're shaping them.

### The Numbers

Market cap: roughly $125-130 billion as of late 2025.[^27] 21Shares projects over $300 billion by 2027. Bloomberg Intelligence: $2.8 trillion by 2030.[^28]

160 million+ blockchain addresses hold stablecoins. An estimated 50-75 million people globally.[^29] Circle's CEO cites 500 million+ digital wallets with stablecoin functionality.

USDT on Tron alone handles $24.6 billion in daily transfers — seven times Ethereum's stablecoin volume.[^30]

McKinsey calls stablecoins "the first true market fit for digital assets in payments." a16z says they might "rival the size of the credit card industry within a decade."[^31]

The machine is running. A detailed directory of who's building it — issuers, payment networks, tech giants, banks, blockchain rails, infrastructure providers, and VC capital — is in the appendix for reference.[^32] The question is what it's building toward — and for whom.
