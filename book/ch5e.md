## The Missing Safety Net

If stablecoins replace bank accounts for hundreds of millions of people, what replaces the protections those accounts came with?

Bank deposits in the US are insured up to $250,000 by FDIC. In the EU, 100,000 euros by national deposit guarantee schemes. In the UK, 85,000 pounds by FSCS.

Self-custodied stablecoins have zero insurance. If your wallet is hacked, if the issuer fails, if a smart contract is exploited — you lose everything. No bailout. No guarantee. No recourse.

### What's Being Built

The protections aren't there yet. But they're forming.

**Nexus Mutual:** A decentralized insurance protocol covering smart contract failures and depeg events. Roughly $200 million in coverage written. Paid claims after the Euler hack.

**GENIUS Act provisions:** Mandates that stablecoin issuers maintain bankruptcy-remote reserve structures — reserves are legally separated from the issuer's other assets and protected from bankruptcy claims. Not the same as FDIC insurance, but structurally meaningful.

**Proof of Reserve:** Chainlink's on-chain verification that reserves actually exist. Not insurance, but a transparency mechanism that reduces the need for insurance by making lies detectable.

**FDIC pass-through:** Some stablecoin-focused neobanks are exploring FDIC pass-through insurance — if stablecoins are held at an FDIC-insured bank partner, the insurance may extend to the stablecoin deposits. This is legally untested at scale.

### The Honest Reality

As of 2026, there is no FDIC equivalent for stablecoins. The industry is building toward it — insurance protocols, regulatory mandates, proof of reserves — but it's not there yet.

This is one of the strongest arguments for using stablecoins through regulated custodians rather than pure self-custody, especially for non-technical users. Your bank account is insured. Your stablecoin wallet is not — yet.

The protection is being built. But today, you are your own safety net.

### The Recovery Pattern

The ecosystem has a track record of surviving its failures. Not without pain — real people lost real money in every crash. But structurally, the system gets harder to kill each time.

Terra vaporized $40 billion. Within 18 months, the stablecoin market cap recovered and surpassed pre-crash levels. But the composition shifted — less algorithmic, more reserve-backed.

FTX collapsed with over $8 billion in customer funds missing. Tether honored $7 billion in redemptions without breaking. The market interpreted this as a stress test passed.

USDC depegged to $0.87 when SVB collapsed. It recovered in 72 hours. Circle diversified reserves to BNY Mellon and Federal Reserve overnight repo facilities.

Each crisis killed the weakest design and left the survivors stronger.

The question for the reader is not "are stablecoins safe?" No financial instrument is unconditionally safe. The question is: are they safe ENOUGH, and are they getting safer fast enough, for the people who need them most?

The answer is honest: not yet. But the trajectory is clear. And for a Venezuelan family, a Nigerian trader, a Zimbabwean savings club — the alternative isn't safety. The alternative is guaranteed loss through inflation, exclusion, and broken systems.

That's the tension this book holds. Not resolved. Held.
