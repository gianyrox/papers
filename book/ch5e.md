## What Gets Better

Every failure in this chapter left the ecosystem structurally stronger than before. That's worth examining — because the pattern of improvement is itself the strongest argument for stablecoins' long-term viability.

### The Track Record

Terra vaporized $40 billion. Within 18 months, the stablecoin market cap had recovered and surpassed its pre-crash level — but the composition shifted permanently toward fully-backed designs. Algorithmic stablecoins went from 10%+ of the market to near zero.

FTX collapsed with $8 billion in customer funds missing. Tether honored over $7 billion in redemptions without breaking the peg. The industry responded with proof-of-reserves requirements and pushed exchanges toward transparency.

USDC depegged to $0.87 when Silicon Valley Bank failed. It recovered in 72 hours when the FDIC backstopped deposits. Circle responded by diversifying banking relationships and launching CCTP for cross-chain interoperability.

Each crisis killed the weakest design and left the survivors stronger. The pattern: catastrophic failure → industry consolidation → improved standards → regulatory response → higher baseline. Every cycle, the floor rises.

### Insurance and Safety Nets

The infrastructure to protect against failures is being built — unevenly, but measurably.

InsurAce and Bridge Mutual offer decentralized insurance covering smart contract failures and depeg events. Nexus Mutual paid out $14 million in claims after the Terra collapse. Coinbase provides FDIC insurance on fiat balances (though not on crypto holdings).

S\&P has explored rating stablecoins on the quality of their reserves. Depeg insurance exists as a product category. The building blocks of a trust infrastructure are being assembled — not by governments, but by the market responding to demonstrated need.

The GENIUS Act mandates bankruptcy-remote reserve structures — meaning stablecoin reserves are legally separated from the issuer's other assets. If a stablecoin issuer goes bankrupt, the reserves are protected from creditor claims. This is a meaningful structural improvement over the pre-regulation environment, where Tether's reserves had no such legal protection.

### What Doesn't Exist Yet

Full deposit insurance equivalent to FDIC coverage. A lender of last resort for stablecoin runs. A global regulatory framework rather than the patchwork of national regulations currently emerging. A decentralized stablecoin that is simultaneously stable, scalable, and resistant to censorship.

These gaps are real. The ecosystem is building in the open, and the incomplete parts are visible to everyone. For a Venezuelan family, a Nigerian trader, a Zimbabwean savings club — the alternative isn't a perfect system. The alternative is guaranteed loss through inflation, exclusion through identity requirements, and extraction through 6-7% remittance fees.

### The Trajectory

The bet this book makes is directional, not absolute.

Stablecoin infrastructure will improve. Regulation will tighten. Reserve transparency will increase. Bad actors will be weeded out. The technology will become more user-friendly, more private, and more interoperable.

Will it happen fast enough? Will regulation arrive before the next crisis? Will the most vulnerable users be protected? These aren't questions with predetermined answers. They're questions whose answers depend on the decisions made in the next three to five years by regulators, issuers, developers, and users.

The trajectory is clear. The arrival is not guaranteed. And for the people already living in the future — the ones who appear in the next and final chapter — the trajectory was enough.
