# I Wrote This for My Dad

I watched a reel in 2025 where someone counted how many times the word "stablecoin" was said at a financial conference. It was a lot. And something clicked.

Not about crypto. I'd been in that world for years — hackathons, Web3 projects, the whole ecosystem. This was different. This wasn't about volatile tokens or speculative trading or the latest meme coin. This was about money itself.

A stablecoin is a dollar on a blockchain ledger instead of a bank ledger. That's it. Same dollar. Different infrastructure. And that single shift — moving existing money from private bank databases to a shared, programmable, global ledger — unlocks everything you're about to read in this book.

I know this not because I read a white paper. I know it because I live it.

My cofounder is in Punta Arenas, Chile. He's the godfather of my child. We run a business together across two continents. And moving money between us is a nightmare. Jumping between banks, intermediaries, account types. Certain banks won't send to certain banks. Two people who share a godchild can't easily share money across a border.

I built a platform for sportfishing competitions — derby.fish. Sub-dollar entry fees for fishing derbies. The prize pool needs to be 100% whole. But processing fees — a percentage plus a flat fee on every transaction — either gouge the customer or eat the prize. Stablecoins unlock the entire product. Without them, micro-derbies are economically impossible.

And then there's my dad.

I have spent hours — truly, hours — explaining Bitcoin, blockchain, crypto. He asks "what is Bitcoin?" the way you'd ask what's for dinner. Not hostile. Not opposed. Just... willfully unbothered. He lets it pass over his head. Every time. Not because he's incapable. Because nobody has explained it in a way that matters to him.

This is not a Bitcoin book. Not a crypto-hype book. Not a technology manual. It's a book about the future of money for everyone — and the people already living in it.

I wrote this for my dad. And for everyone like him.
