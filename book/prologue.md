# I Wrote This for My Dad

I watched a reel in 2025 where someone counted how many times the word "stablecoin" was said at a financial conference. It was a lot. And something clicked.

Not about crypto. I'd been in that world for years — hackathons, Web3 projects, the whole ecosystem. This was different. This wasn't about volatile tokens or speculative trading or the latest meme coin. This was about money itself.

A stablecoin is a dollar on a blockchain ledger instead of a bank ledger. That's it. Same dollar. Different infrastructure. And that single shift — moving existing money from private bank databases to a shared, programmable, global ledger — unlocks everything you're about to read in this book.

I know this not because I read a white paper. I know it because I live it.

My cofounder is in Punta Arenas, Chile. He's the godfather of my child. We run a business together across two continents. And moving money between us is a nightmare. I've lost count of the bank transfers that bounced, the intermediary fees that appeared without explanation, the wire that got stuck for four days because one bank in the chain flagged it for compliance review and nobody told us until we called three times. Jumping between banks, intermediaries, account types. Certain banks won't send to certain banks. Two people who share a godchild can't easily share money across a border.

I have friends in the UK and Italy — people I've known for years. We've split costs for trips, lent each other money, tried to settle up across currencies and countries. The friction is absurd. One bank charges £25 for an international wire. Another adds a 3% FX markup buried in the exchange rate. One time, a friend in London sent me money and it arrived six days later — with an unexplained £8 deducted along the way. Nobody could tell us where the £8 went. It just... disappeared into the pipes.

The propaganda is internalized. My UK friends will defend their banking system as functional. "It works fine," they say. And it does — if "fine" means losing money to invisible fees, waiting days for international transfers, and accepting that moving money between countries should cost 3-7% for no reason other than institutional overhead and regulatory friction that adds no value to the actual humans involved.

I built a platform for sportfishing competitions — derby.fish. Sub-dollar entry fees for fishing derbies. The prize pool needs to be 100% whole. But processing fees — a percentage plus a flat fee on every transaction — either gouge the customer or eat the prize. A $2 entry with a $0.30 + 2.9% processing fee loses 18% before the first line hits the water. Stablecoins unlock the entire product. Without them, micro-derbies are economically impossible.

And then there's my dad.

I have spent hours — truly, hours — explaining Bitcoin, blockchain, crypto. He asks "what is Bitcoin?" the way you'd ask what's for dinner. Not hostile. Not opposed. Just... willfully unbothered. He lets it pass over his head. Every time. Not because he's incapable. Because nobody has explained it in a way that matters to him.

My dad kept a notebook. Not as elaborate as Mika's father's — no columns of IOUs tracked across oceans. But the same impulse. Notes about money sent, money owed, money expected. He'd update it at night, after dinner, squinting at the numbers. The notebook was his way of tracking what the banking system couldn't make simple.

This is not a Bitcoin book. Not a crypto-hype book. Not a technology manual. It's a book about the future of money for everyone — and the people already living in it.

I wrote this for my dad. And for everyone like him.
