# The Bridge

## The Core Innovation

Before we talk about who's using stablecoins and where, we need to understand what actually changed. Not the token. The ledger.

Here's the innovation stack, in three lines:

Fiat currency was an innovation. Governments said "this paper is worth something" and enough people believed it to make it work.

Blockchain was an innovation. A global, shared, always-on ledger that doesn't need a central authority to validate transactions.

Putting fiat onto a blockchain is a *new* innovation. Not new money. New rails.

A stablecoin is a dollar that lives on a blockchain instead of in a bank database. Same dollar. Same value. Same purchasing power. But on infrastructure that is open, programmable, global, and instant.

This sounds simple. It is simple. And that simplicity is exactly what makes it powerful.

## The Ledger, Not the Token, Is the Innovation

Many economists and technologists argue the true breakthrough lies not in WHAT the value is, but in HOW it moves. The key innovation is the open, distributed ledger. The rail is revolutionary, even though the "train" — the dollar — is familiar.

MIT's Digital Currency Initiative puts it this way: cryptocurrencies introduced a new ledger technology — global, near-instant, operating without centralized clearing. Stablecoins harness this technology for fiat money.

Circle's CEO Jeremy Allaire says stablecoins "standardize the transport" of dollars without changing the dollars. Andrew Bailey, former Governor of the Bank of England, said digital currencies "will create not just a novel form of money, but also a new payment infrastructure."

You can think of it like this. The dollar is the letter. The banking system is the postal service. Stablecoins are email.

The letter didn't change. How it gets there changed completely.

## What Changes When Money Lives on a Shared Ledger

Today's financial system is a patchwork of ledgers. Every bank maintains its own database. Central banks have theirs. Payment processors have separate ones. Moving money between them requires reconciliation — multiple institutions verifying with each other that the numbers match, that the money is real, that the sender has permission to send.

If a payment flows via a stablecoin on a blockchain, sender and receiver simply update the same global ledger. No reconciliation between institutions. No intermediary chain. No correspondent bank taking a day and a fee.

Settlement is final and instant. No "pending" status. No five-day hold.

Access is wallet-based, not account-based. Anyone with a phone can participate. No credit check, no minimum balance, no physical branch.

There is no domestic versus international distinction. Money on a shared ledger doesn't know borders. Sending $200 from New York to Lagos costs the same and takes the same time as sending $200 from one wallet to another in the same city.

24/7 operation. No banking hours. No cut-off times. No "your transfer will be processed on the next business day."

The conceptual leap is like the move from fax machines — point-to-point, incompatible across providers — to the internet: one network of networks. Money gets its internet moment.

## The Container Shipping Analogy

In September 2025, the American Institute for Economic Research published a paper with a title that tells you everything: "What Shipping Containers Did for Trade, Stablecoins Can Do for Money."

Before standardized shipping containers, global trade was labor-intensive and slow. Every port had different equipment. Every shipment required manual loading and unloading. Goods sat in warehouses for days or weeks waiting for transfer.

Then someone built a standard box. Same dimensions everywhere. Any ship, any port, any truck, any train. Global trade exploded — from $100 billion in 1960 to over $25 trillion today. Containers didn't replace ships. They standardized transport.

Stablecoins don't replace the dollar. They standardize its digital transport.

"If we define the standard, the world will adopt it. If we hesitate, others will fill the vacuum."

By defining basic rules and formats — technical standards, reserve standards, disclosure requirements — analogous to defining container dimensions — governments can make stablecoins safe, interoperable, and scalable. This is exactly what the GENIUS Act and MiCA are doing.

This analogy comes back later in the book. Remember it.

## This Isn't Unprecedented

The history of money is a history of ledger upgrades. Stablecoins stand in a long lineage.

**15th century: Double-entry bookkeeping.** Italian merchants developed a reliable ledger system that gave businesses — for the first time — a trustworthy record of who owed what to whom. It laid the groundwork for modern finance.

**1973: SWIFT.** Standardized interbank messaging worldwide, massively speeding up international transfers. But SWIFT just sends messages — the actual movement of funds still hops through correspondent banks. Stablecoins cut out those hops.

**19th century: The telegraph.** Enabled the first electronic fund transfers — wire transfers sent via Morse code — compressing settlement from weeks to minutes. Stablecoins compress it further: seconds, 24/7.

**1960s-70s: Eurodollars.** This is the closest analog. In the 1960s, US dollars started accumulating in European banks, outside US regulation. They were initially viewed with suspicion — unregulated dollars floating around offshore. But they became integral to global finance. The US eventually supported them because they entrenched dollar dominance worldwide.

Stablecoins are the Eurodollars of the 21st century. Wharton researchers in 2025 called them "crypto's Bretton Woods for the dollar." The difference: Eurodollars were institutional, accessible only to banks and large corporations. Stablecoins started retail — accessible to anyone with a phone.

Same dynamic: offshore dollar proliferation that entrenches dollar dominance. Different access: everyone instead of just institutions.

**2007: M-Pesa.** Kenya's mobile money system went from zero to over 50% of Kenyan adults in five years. Academic research published in *Science* in 2016 found that M-Pesa "increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households — 2% of Kenyan households — out of extreme poverty." 185,000 women moved from subsistence farming to business occupations.

The parallels to stablecoins are direct: driven by collapse of trust in banks and the need for remittances. Same dynamic, same urgency. M-Pesa itself is now integrating blockchain infrastructure — mobile money 2.0, global edition.

**1950s-80s: Credit cards.** It took 20-30 years for credit cards to reach ubiquity. The chicken-and-egg problem — acceptance versus usage — is the same one stablecoins face now. But the timeframe could compress to 10-15 years due to internet-speed network effects.

**1990s: The internet itself.** S-curve adoption. Long, slow start. Then explosive growth when ease of use reached critical mass. Stablecoins are approaching the tipping point where fintech apps abstract the blockchain completely — where the user doesn't know or care that they're using a blockchain, the same way you don't think about TCP/IP when you load a webpage.

**1800s: The free banking era.** The last time private entities had this much monetary power over currency issuance. Results were mixed — some private currencies held value beautifully, others collapsed. Stablecoins face the same tension. Regulation — like the GENIUS Act — is the attempt to learn from that history.

The pattern repeats: skepticism, then early adoption by the desperate and the visionary, then regulation catches up, then mainstream integration, then ubiquity. Stablecoins are at the "regulation catches up" stage.

## The Velocity Argument

Here's a number that should make you pause.

The Cato Institute analyzed stablecoin velocity — how many times a single stablecoin dollar turns over per year. The average: 109 times. Some stablecoins turned over at 914 times per year.

Compare that to the M2 money supply — the broad measure of dollars in the traditional economy. M2 velocity is in the single digits. One stablecoin dollar does the work of dozens of traditional dollars.

This isn't an accident. Instant settlement, continuous availability, and programmability generate liquidity without leverage. Small pools of stablecoin capital support enormous transaction volumes. The technology itself creates efficiency.

"The technology on its own generates liquidity, without the need for leverage."

The velocity leap is like the jump from mail to email. Money moves nearly at the speed of information.

## The On-Ramp as the New Institution

Money enters the stablecoin world through on-ramps — fiat-to-stablecoin conversion. You hand over dollars, you receive USDC. You hand cash to a MoneyGram agent, you receive USDC in your Stellar wallet.

These on-ramps are becoming the new systemically critical institutions. They are the gates between the old system and the new one. Trust comes from reserves — are the dollars actually there? Transparency — can you verify it? Redemption guarantees — can you get your dollars back?

Circle publishes monthly reserve reports. Tether publishes quarterly attestations. The GENIUS Act mandates regular audits and bankruptcy-remote reserve structures. The on-ramp is where the old world's need for trust meets the new world's tools for verification.

## Why This Matters More Than It Sounds

Every single use case in the next section — every remittance corridor, every savings story, every payroll platform, every micropayment — is a *consequence* of this one architectural change.

Every broken system in the last chapter was broken for the same reason: money lives in fragmented private ledgers. Move it to a shared ledger, and the problems dissolve. Not magically. Not overnight. Not without new risks.

But structurally. Architecturally. The foundations shift.

The rest of this chapter shows you who's already building on those new foundations — and what their lives look like now.
