## Who Loses

If stablecoins win, somebody loses. A credible book names them — and gives them faces.

### The Agent at the Window

Maria worked the Western Union counter at a strip mall in Houston for eleven years. She knew her regulars — the Guatemalan construction worker who came in every Friday, the Salvadoran grandmother who sent money back for school uniforms, the Nigerian nurse who wired part of every paycheck to Lagos. Maria processed their paperwork, checked their IDs, counted their cash, and charged the fee.

The fee was the business. Western Union and MoneyGram's core model for a century: charge 5-7% to move money across borders.[^1] That's $58 billion a year globally, extracted from the working class.

Maria's strip mall location closed in 2025. The company said it was "consolidating." She knew why. The construction worker stopped coming in eighteen months ago — his cousin showed him an app. The grandmother learned from her daughter. The nurse switched when a Nigerian colleague told her about a faster, cheaper way.

Western Union launched its own stablecoin — USDPT — and MoneyGram integrated USDC.[^2] They're adapting. But they're adapting by eliminating the jobs that sustained people like Maria. The high-margin fee model is dying. The companies may survive as off-ramp infrastructure and technology platforms. They won't survive as toll collectors. And the hundreds of thousands of agents, cashiers, and counter workers in 180 countries who processed those toll payments are the first casualties.[^3]

### The Correspondent Banker

Somewhere in a London office, a relationship manager at a mid-tier European bank oversees correspondent banking ties with African institutions. His job exists because Nigerian and Kenyan banks can't reach the US dollar system directly — they need intermediaries in London or New York to route their transactions.

Deutsche Bank estimates $50-100 billion in annual correspondent banking revenue at risk by 2030.[^4] Over 20% of correspondent banking relationships have already been cut since 2011 — not because of stablecoins, but because compliance costs exceeded revenue.[^5] Stablecoins accelerate the collapse.

The six-hop chain that moves $200 from New York to Lagos — each intermediary taking a cut — becomes a single ledger transfer. The relationship manager's job doesn't just shrink. The entire function his role exists to perform — bridging institutional ledgers across borders — becomes architecturally unnecessary.

### The Central Banker Watching Seigniorage Evaporate

When Nigerians hold USDT instead of naira, the Central Bank of Nigeria loses seigniorage — the profit a government earns from issuing currency.[^6] Tether earned over $13 billion from reserves in 2024.[^7] That revenue — earned on dollars backing stablecoins held by Nigerian, Turkish, and Argentine citizens — flows to a private company in the British Virgin Islands. It used to flow to governments.

Standard Chartered estimates stablecoins could draw $1 trillion in emerging market bank deposits over three years.[^8] For a country like Nigeria (GDP ~$370 billion), or Zimbabwe, or Lebanon, the loss of seigniorage and deposit base isn't an academic concern. It's a fiscal crisis.

The IMF reported that stablecoin inflows have "further weakened local currencies, reducing central banks' ability to conduct effective policy."[^9] What's rational for the individual — converting to digital dollars to preserve savings — is destabilizing for the collective. The central banker who watches this happen isn't a villain. She's a public servant watching the tools of her profession become less effective with every conversion.

### The Privacy You Lose

Every stablecoin transaction on a public blockchain is more traceable than cash. The informal cash economy — anonymous, untaxed, unmonitored — gets partially digitized. For tax authorities in developed countries, this is a windfall. For people in authoritarian regimes, it could be worse than cash.

A dissident in Russia. A union organizer in a country that criminalizes labor activism. A woman in a conservative society who needs to move money without her husband's knowledge. Cash gave these people financial privacy by default. Public blockchain ledgers take it away by default.[^10]

Zero-knowledge privacy tools exist, but they're not yet the norm. And governments are actively working to prevent their adoption — Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the US Treasury for providing financial privacy that also enabled illicit transactions.[^11]

The privacy loss is not hypothetical. It's structural. And it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable.

### The Fee Margins That Compress

Visa and Mastercard charge 2-3% per transaction.[^12] Stablecoin payments cost less than $0.01. The networks won't die — they're integrating stablecoins as settlement rails — but their fee margins compress. Over time, they become routing layers and compliance infrastructure, not toll collectors. Shareholders and employees throughout the payment processing industry feel the squeeze.

FX brokers and retail currency traders face similar pressure. If people hold USD stablecoins instead of converting through local banks, the $7.5 trillion daily FX market[^13] doesn't disappear, but the retail FX markup of 3-5% on consumer transactions gets competed away.

### The Deposit Base That Shifts

If users hold stablecoins in self-custody wallets instead of bank deposits, banks lose the cheap funding they use to make loans. The power dynamic shifts from "banks hold your money by default" to "banks compete for your money."

This sounds like market discipline. It is. It's also destabilizing. Banks fund mortgages, business loans, and consumer credit with deposits. If deposits flow out to stablecoin wallets, credit availability could tighten — especially for small businesses and consumers who depend on bank lending.[^14]

These losses are real. The argument is that the gains outweigh them — that the $58 billion extracted annually from remittance workers matters more than the fee revenue of the companies doing the extracting. That financial access for 1.4 billion unbanked people matters more than the institutional infrastructure that excluded them.

The gains are measured in liberation. The losses are measured in livelihoods. Both are denominated in human dignity.

The people building this book's case for stablecoins — Pablo, Mercy, Femi, Mika — are gaining from the same shift that costs Maria her counter job, that erodes Nigeria's seigniorage, that compresses Visa's margins. Pretending otherwise would make this a pamphlet, not a book.
