How ChatGPT Will Ruin the World
From libraries, to Google, to ChatGPT — knowledge seeking has evolved over time, and has become more efficient at every stage.

For those unaware, ChatGPT is an OpenAI software that gives precise human-like answers to any prompt or question queried.

So how does ChatGPT work?

The tool is built on GPT-3 AI technology. The “3” stands for the third generation and GPT stands for “Generative Pretrained Transformer.” Now what does that mean? It seems quite complex but it does not take too much thinking to understand. “Pretrained” means the model is trained before usage. Easy enough, right? It is trained with 175 billion parameters taken from around 50 years of internet data! It is trained using a “Transformer” architecture. A “Transformer” is a novel data architecture used in Natural Language Processing that relies on Self-Attention… It is basically an efficient and accurate method for training a data model, and in this case, helps to quickly and accurately respond to questions. The transformer allows for “Generative” responses, meaning, the AI responds to a query word after word, instead of finding an answer in it’s huge pool of knowledge. You can think of this as if someone were to ask you to present them with a method for solving the following math problem:

What is the value of x if x + 2 = 3?
One option would be to find a method for solving the problem in a Pre-Algebra Textbook, cut it out, and present them with the method.
Another would be to actively create and write down a method for solving the problem using your memory and brain.
If ChatGPT were to answer this question, it would do the latter! The “Generative” part of GPT effectively makes ChatGPT respond and think like a human.

A little freaky isn’t it.

So, unlike Google — which gives loads of unneeded answers because it uses the former copy and paste answer method discussed above — ChatGPT provides one detailed answer to a query. From asking about the population of giraffes in Africa, to debugging 2000 lines of code, ChatGPT knows it all. If you have not used it yet, check it out here.

Simply sign up and search away! You may be astounded at how quickly you find your desired answers. (Be aware that at the time of posting this article, ChatGPT was exploding with new users and had to halt new users from joining until they could handle a higher capacity. This may not be the case anymore.)

So why will ChatGPT ruin the world?

Well, the way it seems, there are three areas that the tool impacts:

The Individual;
The Job Market;
The Tech Economy.
The Individual
Due to the rate at which ChatGPT can solve problems and find answers, the individual is at a great disadvantage if they do not use ChatGPT in their endeavors. ChatGPT empowers individuals so much that if one is not using ChatGPT for aid, they will fall behind. Normally, a digital creator may take a couple hours to write and post an article, but with ChatGPT, they can enter a prompt and post the response in minutes. There are already tons of creators using AI to create content.

The scary part here is that people reading an article on the internet may not know if the article was written by a human or by an AI…

As such, many may become “imposter experts” as they can pretend to be experts in a subject using ChatGPT. One does not need to know much about anything if they mindlessly use ChatGPT. Another scary aspect is the possibility of an echo chamber of human knowledge if everyone gains inspiration from ChatGPT instead of finding it within themselves. Since ChatGPT relies on internet data from the past 50 years, it can not come up with anything new — humans must use their own inspiration to find new ideas or our intelligence will be capped at ChatGPT’s knowledge base.

The ability to become a faux expert in any subject removes the need for one to hire experts in different fields. The next section discusses how the tool affects the job market.

The Job Market
With the immense increase in individual efficiency that ChatGPT creates, one loses the need to hire an expert in a given field. This can be of great detriment to current experts and to the individual. Someone who has specific knowledge in a given field can not only provide knowledge on the subject, they can also teach valuable lessons based on their experience in the field. This is a valuable asset that ChatGPT does not offer. Take the example of a startup founder. ChatGPT can:

write a co-founder contract agreement instead of speaking with a lawyer;
make a logo instead of hiring an artist;
write blogposts instead of hiring a digital marketer.
The founder can do all this without speaking to another human and may not be able to build lasting connections or learn from others’ experiences. The founder may only be thinking of the desired output and the very basic skills needed.

There are many more examples of how chatGPT may empower an individual, and you may think that these empowerments may already exist using google, however, ChatGPT’s ease of use and accuracy is beyond compare to any other software created to answer a person’s prompts and questions.

Continue reading to see how this technology fits in the market.

The Tech Economy
ChatGPT has already become individuals’ dominant knowledge seeking system. It is only a matter of time before search engines like Google become obsolete. With quick and accurate satisfying results, ChatGPT will unresistably become the primary searching system for individuals.

The OpenAI product will also allow startups and businesses to iterate and put out content much quicker. Thus, there will be rapid growth across all markets that adopt this AI technology. However, this is not the only AI gaining traction. Here are a couple more examples of AI using GPT-3 technology:

Copy.ai is an AI copywriting and editing software used for marketing a business.
https://www.copy.ai
Jasper.ai is a content and art generator for marketing businesses and Digital Creators.
https://www.jasper.ai
Hypotenuse AI is a factual content creator used for marketing businesses.
https://www.hypotenuse.ai
As you can see, AI technology based on GPT-3 seems to be taking over content-based digital marketing. Where else may this technology be applied?

One great application of GPT-3 is the education industry. Programmers have already used ChatGPT to find quick and exact answers to their coding questions. Instead of looking for a 10 line solution to their problem on google and various forums for a couple hours, they can find a 1 liner bit of code in seconds that targets the exact issue. As you can see, ChatGPT teaches programmers how to become more efficient programmers.

Beyond programming, it is only a matter of time before the technology gains widespread usage. This technology can help any person in any walk of life. ChatGPT has also already become a buzzword among tech enthusiasts and News Outlets. One can only wait anxiously for these impacts to take effect.

So is there anything good that comes from ChatGPT?

YES, obviously.

It has been mentioned a few times in this article that individuals gain massive amounts of power with ChatGPT — with expert level knowledge, quick accurate answers, and human like written responses; individual human efficiency levels will increase tenfold, if not a hundred fold with the help of ChatGPT.

The fact is that when one encounters a roadblock, the amount of time it would have taken to overcome the roadblock has been minimized to the amount of time that it takes to properly articulate it to ChatGPT; maximum of a few minutes and as small as a couple seconds.

Human efficiency increases… but what about intelligence? What stops people from using it to complete tasks and not learn from it?

One must understand that completion of tasks has become effortless with ChatGPT. Priority must be given to the growth of human knowledge and learning so to keep humans from becoming mindless task completers. This defines a future where assignments (whether at work or in school) inspire and demand growth and learning over simple completion. ChatGPT can complete nearly anything, so we must prioritize a responsible usage of the tool.

It must also be recognized that ChatGPT amplifies the identity of its users. It empowers users in a way that allows them to pursue their passions efficiently. It also shows user intentions. If a person uses ChatGPT just to copy results instead of learning from the results, they are effectively becoming robotic and mindless. Their use of ChatGPT would be of detriment to themselves as they would have no acquired knowledge or skills to show. (However, it is quite difficult to believe that a human could never learn from results presented by ChatGPT.)

A responsible usage of ChatGPT would be to treat every response as a lesson, as if the questions you ask are to a teacher, not a robot that completes tasks.

This technology could inspire curiosity and makes it quite easy to seek knowledge. A future society of generalists, polymaths, and inventors seems to be in course as opposed to a future of humans with heavy specialization in one area and no broad knowledge or understanding. (A polymath is someone who is knowledgeable ina. wide range of subjects. skilled in any subject which involves math. )

If you are interested in joining the frontier of the Digital Rennaissance, The Bucket Foundation is leading the movement.

The problem with ChatGPT is that you still have to know something (quite a lot, actually) about the topics you use it for. The program snippets are sometimes really buggy, and in the best case you get compilation errors, so you notice them. The text…more

After having read this sentence in your post, I cannot take a word of yours seriously. Goggle or ask ChatGPT what “polymath” means.
