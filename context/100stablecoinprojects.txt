100 Stablecoin Company Opportunities

Stablecoins have rapidly grown from a niche experiment to mainstream financial tools. In Q2 2024 alone, stablecoins handled $8.5 trillion in on-chain transaction volume – more than double Visa's payment volume in the same period. Leading crypto figures and investors view stablecoins as a crucial bridge between crypto and traditional finance, with the greatest disruption potential in areas like cross-border B2B payments, global payouts, and remittances.

Stablecoins are not only popular in developed markets; they have become financial lifelines in many emerging economies, giving people easier access to stable currency (often US dollars) where local currencies are unstable. With the stablecoin market expected to expand dramatically in the coming years, there are abundant opportunities for entrepreneurs to build high-impact companies in this space.
