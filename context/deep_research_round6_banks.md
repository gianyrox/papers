# Deep Research Prompt 2: US Inflation, Debanking, T-Bill Symbiosis, and CBDCs

## Context

I'm writing a book called "Your Money Is Broken: How Stablecoins Bridge Slow Money to Fast Money." Non-fiction narrative, direct tone, data-heavy but human-first. Think Michael Lewis meets monetary policy. The book argues stablecoins are the most important financial infrastructure innovation since SWIFT, while honestly reckoning with risks.

This research covers four interconnected topics that feed into different chapters. I need specific data points, named examples, exact figures with sources, and quotes from principals — not summaries or generalizations.

---

## TOPIC A: US Inflation History + Stablecoins as Hedge

### What This Is For
The book argues "the US is not invulnerable to inflation" and that even Americans — not just people in Argentina or Turkey — have been hurt by purchasing power erosion. This is for Chapter 3C (What Changes for You — the developed-world reader) and feeds into the argument that stablecoins offering 4-8% yield aren't just a crypto novelty, they're a rational response to a real problem.

### What I Need

**1. US CPI data across major inflationary periods:**
- 1970s stagflation: peak monthly/annual CPI readings, the double-dip (1974 and 1979-80), peak rate (was it 14.8% in March 1980?), what drove it (oil embargo, Vietnam spending, Fed policy under Burns)
- Paul Volcker's intervention: how high did he take the fed funds rate (20%+?), the recession it caused, unemployment peak
- 2008 crisis: the crisis itself was deflationary, but quantitative easing (QE1, QE2, QE3) — total Fed balance sheet expansion from ~$900B to ~$4.5T. What happened to asset prices vs. wage earners? The K-shaped recovery. CPI stayed low but asset inflation (housing, stocks) exploded — who benefited and who didn't?
- 2020-2024 post-COVID inflation: CPI peaked at 9.1% in June 2022. Monthly progression. What drove it (stimulus checks, supply chain, energy). How the Fed responded (rate hikes from 0% to 5.25-5.5%). What it felt like for ordinary Americans.

**2. Cumulative purchasing power loss:**
- What is $1 from January 2020 worth in purchasing power as of late 2024/early 2025? (I believe roughly $0.80 — verify)
- What is $1 from 1970 worth today?
- What is $1 from 2000 worth today?
- The "silent tax" framing — how much has a retiree on fixed income lost in real terms since 2020?

**3. The savings account gap — the core argument:**
- Average US savings account interest rate during 2020-2023 (I believe big banks paid 0.01-0.06% while inflation was 7-9%)
- The REAL return: if you had $10,000 in a Chase savings account earning 0.01% APY from January 2020 to December 2024, what is it worth in real terms after inflation?
- Compare: if you had $10,000 in a stablecoin earning 4-8% DeFi yield (use Aave USDC rates as benchmark) over the same period, what would it be worth?
- The spread between bank deposit rates and Fed funds rate — banks were paying 0.01% while lending at 5%+. What was the aggregate profit extraction from depositors?
- Any data on total US savings account deposits and the aggregate "inflation tax" Americans paid by holding cash in banks

**4. Historical examples of Americans hurt by inflation:**
- Retirees on Social Security: COLA adjustments vs. actual inflation experienced by seniors (medical costs rising faster than CPI)
- The "money illusion": wages rose nominally but fell in real terms — any data on real wage growth 2020-2024?
- Specific price increases that hit working families: groceries, gas, rent, childcare — specific percentage increases 2020-2024
- Any polling data on Americans' concern about inflation — Gallup, Pew, or similar surveys on inflation as a top concern

**5. International comparison:**
- UK inflation post-COVID: peak CPI, Bank of England response, impact on British households
- Eurozone inflation: peak CPI, ECB response, any country-level variation (Germany vs. Italy vs. Spain)
- How these developed nations experienced similar purchasing power erosion — this isn't a developing-world problem

---

## TOPIC B: Debanking in America

### What This Is For
The book argues that Americans don't have a constitutional right to a bank account, and that recent debanking events show the financial system can exclude people arbitrarily. This feeds into Chapter 3C (why developed-world readers should care) and Chapter 5B (the steel-manned case for stablecoins — even in wealthy countries, banking access is not guaranteed).

### What I Need

**1. Legal basis — no right to a bank account:**
- Is there a constitutional right to a bank account in the US? (I believe no — confirm and explain the legal basis)
- Is there a statutory right? (I believe no, but there may be anti-discrimination laws that partially address this)
- What legal recourse does someone have if a bank closes their account? (I believe: almost none for individual accounts, banks can close accounts at will with minimal notice)
- Any relevant case law or legal scholarship on this

**2. Operation Choke Point (original, Obama-era ~2013):**
- What was it exactly? DOJ/FDIC program to pressure banks to cut off legal-but-disfavored industries
- Which industries were targeted? (payday lenders, gun dealers, adult entertainment, others — give the full FDIC list of "high-risk" merchant categories)
- How did it work mechanically? (regulators didn't ban the businesses — they pressured banks through examination processes and informal guidance)
- Named examples of businesses or individuals who lost banking access
- How and when was it officially ended? (2017 under Trump DOJ?)
- Any FDIC Inspector General reports or congressional investigations
- The argument FOR Choke Point (legitimate anti-fraud concern) and the argument AGAINST (weaponizing banking access against legal businesses)

**3. Operation Choke Point 2.0 (2022-2024) — crypto debanking:**
- The term "Choke Point 2.0" — who coined it, when did it enter the discourse?
- Specific crypto companies and founders who lost banking access — named examples with details:
  - Which companies were debanked?
  - Which banks cut them off?
  - What reasons were given (or not given)?
  - Marc Andreessen's public statements about this (I believe he discussed it on Joe Rogan or similar — when, what did he say, how many founders did he claim were affected?)
- The FDIC letters revealed in 2024 — what were they, what did they show, how were they obtained (FOIA?), what specific language did regulators use to pressure banks?
- Signature Bank and Silvergate: were these failures partly caused by regulatory pressure on crypto-friendly banks? What's the evidence?
- Any OCC or Fed guidance that had the effect of discouraging banks from serving crypto clients

**4. Political debanking examples (non-crypto):**
- Nigel Farage / Coutts (UK, 2023): what happened exactly, what was the internal Coutts memo, how did it become public, what was the political fallout?
- Kanye West: which banks cut him off, when, stated reasons?
- Dr. Joseph Mercola: debanked by which institutions, when?
- Any other notable examples — political figures, activists, controversial public figures
- The broader pattern: banks as private enforcers of political/social norms

**5. The unbanked/underbanked in America:**
- Latest FDIC survey data on unbanked Americans (number and percentage)
- Latest data on underbanked Americans
- Demographic breakdown: who is disproportionately unbanked (race, income, geography)?
- Reasons cited for being unbanked (fees, distrust, documentation, prior account closures)
- ChexSystems: how the banking blacklist works, how many Americans are on it, how long entries last

**6. How stablecoins provide an alternative:**
- Self-custody stablecoins as banking access that can't be revoked
- No credit check, no minimum balance, no ChexSystems
- Current on-ramp options for Americans (Coinbase, PayPal/Venmo USDC, etc.)
- Any data on Americans using stablecoins specifically because they can't get or keep bank accounts
- The philosophical point: stablecoins separate "holding money" from "having institutional permission"

## TOPIC C: T-Bill / Stablecoin Government Symbiosis

### What This Is For
Chapter 4C (The Dollar Question) argues that stablecoins and US Treasury bills create a feedback loop: more stablecoin adoption → more T-bill demand → lower US borrowing costs → US government incentivized to support stablecoins. This is one of the book's most important arguments — that the US government has a structural financial interest in stablecoin proliferation.

### What I Need

**1. Stablecoin reserve mechanics — how it works step by step:**
- When someone buys $1 of USDT: where does that dollar go? Who holds it? In what form?
- The custody chain: user → exchange/OTC desk → Tether → custodian bank → T-bill purchase
- How Tether manages its Treasury portfolio — direct purchases? money market funds? repo?
- How Circle manages USDC reserves — BlackRock's role as reserve manager, the Circle Reserve Fund (USDXX)
- The distinction between direct T-bill holdings and money market fund shares that hold T-bills

**2. Tether reserve composition (latest attestation):**
- Total assets and breakdown by category
- T-bills and overnight repo: exact figure (I have $141.6B — verify and date)
- Gold holdings: amount, making Tether one of the world's largest gold holders
- Bitcoin holdings: amount
- Secured loans: amount ($17B?), the controversy over undisclosed borrowers
- Any other categories
- Who does the attestation? (BDO Italia? Canaccord?) What are the limitations they disclose?

**3. Circle reserve composition:**
- Total USDC outstanding
- Reserve structure: 100% cash and cash equivalents?
- The Circle Reserve Fund (managed by BlackRock) — how it works
- The SVB incident: $3.3B exposure, how it was resolved
- Circle's transparency vs. Tether's — what's actually different in disclosure?

**4. The "third-largest T-bill buyer" claim:**
- Atlantic Council 2025 data or report — exact source, exact ranking
- How stablecoin issuers compare to:
  - JPMorgan Chase (T-bill holdings)
  - China/Japan (foreign holdings of US Treasuries)
  - US money market funds
  - Other major holders
- Total stablecoin issuer T-bill holdings combined (Tether + Circle + others)
- Is the claim "third-largest buyer" or "third-largest holder"? The distinction matters.

**5. The feedback loop — the core argument:**
- If stablecoin market cap reaches $300B (21Shares projection by 2027), how much flows into Treasuries? (Assume 80%+ in T-bills based on current ratios)
- If market cap reaches $2.8T (Bloomberg Intelligence 2030 projection), what does that mean for Treasury demand?
- The GENIUS Act's reserve requirements: 100% reserves in "approved assets" which include T-bills — this legally mandates the feedback loop
- Any economic analysis of how much additional T-bill demand from stablecoins would reduce US borrowing costs
- The BIS finding: a $3.5B increase in stablecoin market cap produces a 2.5-5 basis point reduction in T-bill yields — source, methodology, what this implies at scale
- Scott Bessent (Treasury Secretary) or any other Treasury/Fed officials acknowledging this dynamic
- Congressional testimony or policy papers explicitly discussing the fiscal benefit of stablecoins buying Treasuries

**6. The irony / the Argentine angle:**
- An Argentine converting pesos to USDT → Tether takes the dollar and buys a T-bill → the Argentine is indirectly lending to the US government
- A Nigerian converting naira to USDT → same dynamic
- The flow: emerging market citizen → stablecoin issuer → US Treasury → funds US government operations
- Any academic or think tank analysis framing this as "reverse capital flow" or "digital Eurodollar recycling"

**7. The Eurodollar comparison:**
- How Eurodollars (offshore dollars in non-US banks) similarly funded US debt and extended dollar dominance
- How large was the Eurodollar market at peak? ($13T+?)
- The parallel: Eurodollars were institutional, stablecoins are retail — same dynamic, different access
- Key differences: Eurodollars were in regulated banks, stablecoins are in crypto infrastructure

**8. The fire-sale risk (the flip side):**
- If a mass redemption event forced Tether to liquidate $50-100B in T-bills rapidly, what happens to Treasury markets?
- BIS data on the yield impact of forced selling
- The 2019 repo market crisis and 2020 Treasury market stress as precedents
- How large a forced sale could the Treasury market absorb without disruption?
- FSB warnings about this scenario — specific reports or statements
- How the GENIUS Act's reserve requirements might amplify this risk (100% in liquid assets means 100% is potentially sold in a crisis)

**9. Policy statements acknowledging the symbiosis:**
- Any direct quotes from US officials (Bessent, Yellen, Powell, congressional members) explicitly acknowledging that stablecoins create Treasury demand
- The GENIUS Act legislative debate — did sponsors cite fiscal benefits?
- Think tank reports: Atlantic Council, Brookings, CSIS, Hoover Institution on this topic
- David Sacks ("crypto czar") statements on stablecoins and dollar dominance

## TOPIC D: CBDC Comparison Data

### What This Is For
The entire CBDC section of the book was outlined but never written. It belongs in Chapter 4C (The Dollar Question) as a counterpoint: governments tried to build their own version of what stablecoins do. In almost every case, the government version failed while stablecoins thrived. The thesis: CBDCs are top-down, stablecoins are bottom-up, and markets are choosing the bottom-up version.

### What I Need

**1. e-CNY (China) — the biggest CBDC experiment:**
- Total transactions processed (I have ~3.4 billion — verify and date)
- Total wallets opened (~260 million? — verify)
- Average transaction size (~$60? — verify)
- Total value transacted (7 trillion yuan / ~$1 trillion? — verify)
- How adoption was pushed: government salaries paid in e-CNY, lottery giveaways (how much distributed?), transit system integration, merchant incentives
- Actual organic usage rates vs. forced adoption: what percentage of transactions are genuinely voluntary?
- Cross-border capabilities: mBridge project with BIS, current status, participating central banks
- Privacy model: what can the government see? Is it "controllable anonymity"? What does that mean in practice?
- The irony: China bans crypto but Chinese citizens are among the heaviest USDT users globally — any data on underground USDT usage in China despite the ban?
- Comparison to Alipay/WeChat Pay: why would anyone use e-CNY when mobile payments already work perfectly? What's the adoption argument?
- Any signs of fatigue or resistance from the Chinese public?

**2. eNaira (Nigeria) — the cautionary tale:**
- Launch date (October 2021)
- Adoption rate: what percentage of Nigerians use it? (I have ~0.5% — verify)
- Total users (I have <1 million — verify, get exact number if available)
- Total transaction volume and value
- WHY it failed: lack of merchant adoption, trust issues, technical problems, competition from existing mobile money
- The naira redesign crisis (late 2022/early 2023): did the government try to force eNaira adoption through cash scarcity? What happened?
- Contrast with Nigeria's stablecoin adoption: Nigeria is #1 globally in stablecoin adoption per capita (Chainalysis). How much stablecoin volume does Nigeria process annually? (~$60B in total crypto volume?)
- The Central Bank of Nigeria's response: Governor Cardoso's statements on stablecoins vs. eNaira
- Any policy papers or IMF assessments of the eNaira failure

**3. Jam-Dex (Jamaica):**
- Total in circulation (I have ~$1.6 million — verify)
- Percentage of monetary base (~0.11%? — verify)
- Launch date, adoption rate, challenges
- Why hasn't it gained traction?

**4. Sand Dollar (Bahamas):**
- Similar metrics: total in circulation, adoption rate, challenges
- Launch date (October 2020 — first national CBDC?)
- Any success stories or notable failures?

**5. DCash (Eastern Caribbean Currency Union):**
- Coverage: which islands?
- Adoption metrics
- Technical failures (I believe it went offline for extended periods?)

**6. Digital Euro (EU):**
- Current status: investigation phase? preparation phase?
- Timeline: when is launch expected?
- Christine Lagarde's statements — specific quotes on why the EU needs a digital euro
- Public reception: any polling data on European attitudes toward a digital euro?
- Privacy concerns raised during consultation
- The tension: EU pushing digital euro while MiCA regulates stablecoins — coexistence or competition?

**7. Digital Pound (UK):**
- Current status
- Consultation results: what did the public say?
- Bank of England's framing: "digital banknote" language
- Timeline expectations
- Privacy concerns in UK debate

**8. Other notable CBDCs:**
- India (digital rupee pilot): status, scale, Reserve Bank of India's approach
- Brazil (Drex): status, unique features (programmability focus?)
- Sweden (e-krona): status (Sweden is nearly cashless — unique context)
- Russia (digital ruble): status, sanctions-evasion angle
- Any others worth mentioning for the pattern

**9. The pattern — the thesis:**
- In EVERY country where both a CBDC and stablecoins are available, which sees higher organic adoption?
- The four reasons stablecoins win: (a) privacy — no government surveillance, (b) cross-border capability — CBDCs are mostly domestic, (c) voluntary vs. mandatory — people choose stablecoins, governments push CBDCs, (d) existing network effects — stablecoins already have liquidity and exchange infrastructure
- Any academic research comparing CBDC vs. stablecoin adoption
- The "revealed preference" argument: when given a choice, people choose stablecoins

**10. Key quotes from central bankers:**
- Agustín Carstens (BIS General Manager): statements on CBDCs and stablecoins
- Christine Lagarde (ECB): statements on digital euro necessity, stablecoin risks
- Nigeria CBN Governor Olayemi Cardoso: statements on eNaira, stablecoins
- Any Brazilian central banker on Drex, stablecoins, or the dollar stablecoin usage in Brazil
- Reserve Bank of India governor/officials on digital rupee
- Bank of England officials on digital pound
- Any central banker who has acknowledged that stablecoins are outcompeting CBDCs

**11. IMF/BIS positions:**
- IMF's position on CBDC-stablecoin coexistence: do they see them as complementary or competitive?
- BIS Innovation Hub: mBridge and other cross-border CBDC projects — are they working?
- The "synthetic CBDC" concept (where regulated stablecoins serve CBDC functions) — has any institution endorsed this?
- Any IMF/BIS reports specifically comparing CBDC adoption rates to stablecoin adoption rates

---

## Formatting Requirements

- **Specific numbers with dates and sources.** Not "China has processed billions in e-CNY transactions" — give me "3.4 billion transactions totaling 7.3 trillion yuan ($1.05 trillion) as of [date], according to [source]."
- **Named individuals with exact quotes and dates.** Not "Lagarde expressed concern" — give me the exact quote, when she said it, and where.
- **Sources I can verify.** Academic papers (author, journal, year), official reports (institution, date), news articles (publication, date), official statements (speaker, venue, date).
- **The counterarguments.** For each CBDC, give me the strongest bull case (why proponents say it will work) alongside the data showing it hasn't.
- **Connections between topics.** The T-bill symbiosis connects to CBDCs because CBDCs don't create Treasury demand the way stablecoins do — that's a key difference. The debanking argument connects to CBDCs because a CBDC could solve financial access but introduces surveillance risk. Draw these lines where relevant.

## What I Do NOT Need
- Blockchain technical architecture (consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, etc.)
- Cryptocurrency price predictions or trading analysis
- DeFi protocol mechanics beyond basic yield references
- History of Bitcoin or Ethereum beyond what's directly relevant
- Stablecoin regulation details (covered separately — the GENIUS Act, MiCA, etc. are known)
- Anything I've already written that you can see in the context above — build on the gaps, don't repeat what I have
