SECTION 1: THE GEOPOLITICS OF DIGITAL DOLLARS
------------------------------------------------------------
A. US–China Digital Currency Competition
• Key Findings:
• China’s e-CNY pilot has processed ¥50+ trillion (~$7.3 trillion) by mid-2025, signaling Beijing’s intent
to internationalize the renminbi 1 . Meanwhile, U.S. dollar stablecoins outstanding top $200
billion (2024) 2 , mostly issued by U.S. firms (Tether, Circle). These private stablecoins became the
3rd-largest buyer of U.S. Treasury bills (~$40B) in 2024 3 (Confidence: High).
• The U.S. GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) was passed
in June 2025, creating a federal framework for bank-issued stablecoins 4 5 . Experts project this
could inject $1.75 trillion in new stablecoins globally over 3 years 6 (Confidence: Medium).
• Chinese officials view U.S. stablecoins as a strategic threat: dollar-pegged tokens can bypass capital
controls and leak funds out of China’s closed financial system 7 8 . A former Bank of China vice-
president urged launching an offshore RMB stablecoin, warning that if China “fails to keep up…
international use of the renminbi could be limited”
9
(Confidence: High).
• In Hong Kong (a proxy battleground), authorities in May 2025 legalized and regulated fiat-backed
stablecoins to align with Beijing’s goal of promoting the digital yuan 10 . Simultaneously, U.S.
policymakers doubled down on expanding dollar stablecoins globally 11 (Confidence: High).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Bank-issued dollar stablecoins present a powerful use case as an infinitely divisible, programmable form
of digital money…a new channel for transacting in dollars that the Chinese state cannot fully monitor,
throttle, or shut down.” – Council on Foreign Relations analysis (Aug 2025) 7 .
• “If China fails to keep up with dollar stablecoins in terms of payment efficiency... progress toward
international use of the renminbi could be limited.” – Wang Yongli, ex–Bank of China VP, advocating an
RMB stablecoin 9 .
• “None of those proposals has been silenced by the government. That suggests growing official tolerance—
if not yet full endorsement—for renminbi stablecoins.” – CFR China expert on Beijing’s openness to
controlled stablecoin pilots 12 13 .
• “China... aims to integrate the e-CNY into supply chain financing and cross-border payments – projected
usage $8 billion in 2025.” – People’s Bank of China, via state media 14 (Confidence: High).
• Narrative Thread: In 2019, Facebook’s Libra stablecoin proposal jolted central banks into action 15 .
China raced ahead with its CBDC pilot (e-CNY) to preempt a U.S.-tech stablecoin encroachment. By
2025, the U.S. and China are locked in a monetary arms race: Washington tacitly backs private USD
stablecoins to extend dollar dominance, while Beijing counters by internationalizing its digital
1yuan and contemplating an RMB-pegged stablecoin under strict state control 9 16 . The
competition is as much ideological as technical. The U.S. bets on open, privately innovated money
(with new laws like the GENIUS Act clarifying stablecoins’ legal status 17 18 ), whereas China
pursues a “programmable sovereignty” model – embedding central authority into every digital
yuan transaction 19 . In Hong Kong, these models converge: the city is licensing stablecoin issuers
10 even as it hosts an e-CNY international hub 14 . Early outcomes show divergent strategies:
China’s e-CNY trials amassed huge volumes but remain domestically focused, whereas ~99% of
global stablecoin value is USD-pegged 20 , circulating worldwide via crypto networks beyond any
single government’s reach. Each side is adapting – U.S. regulators increasingly treat stablecoins as a
geopolitical tool (President Trump in 2025 vowed to make America “the crypto capital of the
world” 21 ), and Chinese scholars openly discuss “not losing the stablecoin race” to the U.S. 9 .
• Contrarian Findings: Despite the hype, dollar dominance isn’t guaranteed to deepen unchecked.
J.P. Morgan analysts argue the e-CNY is “unlikely to erode the U.S. dollar’s dominance in global
transactions”, noting USD still comprised 88% of FX trades in 2022 vs. RMB’s 7% 22 . Moreover,
China’s capital controls and the U.S.’s slow rollout of clear crypto rules could constrain each side’s
digital currency ambitions. Another counterpoint is that stablecoin usage today is heavily crypto-
market-centric – an estimated “88% of stablecoin transactions in 2024 were for crypto trading, not real-
world commerce” 23 . If so, stablecoins might not radically reshape sovereign currency influence
unless use cases broaden. Finally, some suggest China’s vigorous promotion of the e-CNY in BRICS
and Belt & Road countries could carve out regional pockets of RMB use despite U.S. stablecoin
growth 24 25 . (Confidence: Medium)

B. BRICS and Alternative Settlement Networks
• Key Findings:
• The BRICS bloc (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) is actively pursuing non-dollar trade
settlement. By end of 2024, 90% of Russia’s trade with BRICS partners was in national
currencies (ruble, yuan, etc.), a sharp pivot away from the USD 38 39 (Confidence: High). President
Putin lauded the rise of ruble-rupee-yuan deals and pushed for an “independent BRICS clearing and
depository system” to speed up this de-dollarization 40 .
• BRICS leaders reaffirmed “commitment to de-dollarization” at the 2025 summit in Rio, calling for
alternative payment systems and criticizing the U.S.’s “unilateral” use of the dollar 41 42 .
Concrete steps include the BRICS Contingent Reserve (a $100B pool in local currencies) and the
New Development Bank issuing $2.1B+ in local-currency loans 43 (Confidence: High).
• Stablecoins play a emerging role: Russia and Iran jointly explored a gold-backed “Persian region”
stablecoin for sanctions-proof trade in early 2023 44 45 . By late 2025, the EU identified a Russian
state-backed stablecoin (A7A5) being used for war financing, prompting EU sanctions on its issuer and
a ban on A7A5 usage in Europe 46 (Confidence: High).
• CIPS vs. SWIFT: China’s Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) has linked with Russia’s SPFS,
enabling some BRICS trades to bypass SWIFT entirely 28 . In 2024, China–Russia trade hit $218B with
a growing share in yuan/rubles, while India–Russia trade (>$66B) largely settled outside dollars 47
(Confidence: High).
• Direct Quotes:
• “The use of national currencies in trade among our countries is steadily growing…90% of Russia’s
settlements with BRICS states [are now in local currency].” – Vladimir Putin, July 2025 BRICS Summit
38 .
• “BRICS…condemn unilateral [dollar-based] measures. We call for alternative payment systems.” – Excerpt
from 2025 BRICS summit declaration (paraphrased from leaders’ remarks) 41 .
• “Stablecoins could replace the US dollar for payments in international trade.” – Report on the planned
Russia–Iran gold-backed stablecoin, aiming to create a “token of the Persian region” for cross-border
use 44 45 .
• “Recent activity has evidenced Russia’s increasing use of crypto… the stablecoin A7A5 – created with
Russian state support – has emerged as a prominent tool for financing [the war].” – EU Council press
release (Oct 23, 2025) 46 .
• Narrative Thread: Long before the term “stablecoin” existed, BRICS nations were chafing under the
“weaponization” of the dollar. U.S. sanctions on Russia (2014 and 2022) and on others have
accelerated efforts to de-dollarize trade. In 2023–2024, these efforts shifted from rhetoric to reality:
Russia began invoicing China and India in rubles/yuan; India paid for Russian oil in dirhams; Brazil
and China struck a deal to trade in yuan. The BRICS Pay initiative and talk of a joint reserve currency
made headlines. While a full BRICS common currency remains aspirational, we see a patchwork of
alternatives emerging – bilateral currency swaps, local-currency clearinghouses, and even trials of
commodity-backed digital currencies. For example, early 2023 rumors suggested Russia and
3Iran’s “Persian Gulf token” would be pegged to gold to facilitate sanctions-free commerce 44 . By
2025, sanctions enforcers took notice: a Kyrgyzstan-based stablecoin (A7A5) reportedly linked to
Russia was blacklisted by the EU 46 . The narrative arc is a “two steps forward, one step back”
journey: each sanction or tariff has BRICS seeking new rails (like CIPS), and each new workaround
(like a state-backed stablecoin) prompts countermeasures. Stablecoins, paradoxically, serve both
sides in this saga. On one hand, USD stablecoins like USDT are widely used in emerging markets
(including BRICS members) as a neutral dollar outside U.S. banking control – Russian companies, for
instance, turned to USDT for trade after SWIFT cutoff, as noted by RAND 48 49 . On the other hand,
BRICS talk of launching non-USD stablecoins (whether a gold token or a BRICS currency on
blockchain) shows an appetite to leverage crypto tech against dollar hegemony. The result is a
geopolitical chess match: every BRICS summit now features announcements on payment
connectivity and pleas for “sovereign digital finance.” In sum, while the U.S. dollar still dominates
(~88% of global FX turnover 22 ), BRICS are steadily building an alternate plumbing – with
stablecoins and CBDCs as the pipes – to reroute flows away from Western-controlled channels.
• Contrarian Findings: Some analysts urge caution in overstating BRICS progress. Standard
Chartered has noted that despite de-dollarization efforts, BRICS still rely on the dollar’s liquidity
and stability for many transactions 50 . The much-publicized idea of a BRICS common currency
backed by a commodity basket has stalled amid diverging economic conditions and distrust among
members 51 . Moreover, while Russia touts 90% non-dollar trade with BRICS 52 , critics point out this
may be skewed by capital controls and the difficulty of using dollars under sanctions – in other
words, a forced outcome, not necessarily a freely chosen one. There’s also the risk that fragmenting
payment systems could increase costs and volatility for BRICS economies themselves (e.g. second-
tier banks in these countries may struggle with fewer correspondent links). Contrarian voices
highlight that even China, the strongest BRICS economy, has a long way to go: the yuan is only
~2.3% of global reserves and ~7% of FX trades 53 . And ironically, dollar stablecoins might
entrench dollar use inside BRICS (as seen in Turkey, Nigeria – non-BRICS EMs where USDT is king).
Thus, the dollar’s “network effect” may simply migrate to digital rails, foiling BRICS’ plans.

C. Dollar Weaponization vs. Stablecoin Neutrality
• Key Findings:
• The U.S. dollar’s “neutrality” as global currency has eroded due to sanctions. The freezing of
Russia’s reserves in 2022 was a “turning point” – many nations now see the dollar as “a tool of
geopolitical coercion” rather than impartial 54 55 (Confidence: High). Over a dozen countries
responded by stockpiling gold and seeking dollar alternatives in payments 56 .
• Stablecoins are emerging as a “neutral dollar.” Analysts note that in financially repressive
regimes, USD stablecoins (USDT, USDC) allow people to access dollars outside the banking system:
“In repressed environments, stablecoins reintroduce a neutral dollar…outside official oversight” 30 . By
2025, stablecoins enabled dollar usage in sanctioned or isolated markets (e.g. in Russia, Turkey,
Venezuela) without direct involvement of U.S. banks (Confidence: High).
• The U.S. government is implicitly leveraging stablecoins to maintain influence. Trump’s 2025
crypto strategy hints at a bifurcated system: allied nations use conventional dollars, while adversarial
or unstable states use “stablecoin dollars” that circulate via blockchain 57 58 . This could extend
dollar dominance without entangling U.S. institutions in every locale (Confidence: Medium).
• However, contrary evidence: stablecoins are not fully beyond U.S. reach. ~75% of reserve assets
backing major stablecoins are in U.S. Treasuries 59 , and issuers like Circle and Tether have complied
with certain sanctions (freezing blacklisted addresses) 60 . Moreover, if stablecoin issuers are
regulated (as under the GENIUS Act 2025), the U.S. can weaponize stablecoins too (e.g. ordering
blacklists), undermining the “neutrality” argument (Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Several countries have taken steps to hedge against dollar exposure… As a result of the dollar’s
‘weaponization’ through sanctions, it appears less like a neutral medium of exchange and more like a tool
of geopolitical coercion.” – Institute of Geoeconomics report (May 2025) 54 .
5• “Stablecoins…offer a way for the dollar to evolve while retaining its global footprint—allowing the US to
export dollar liquidity without the burden of political entanglement… In politically or financially repressed
environments, stablecoins can reintroduce a neutral dollar into local markets.” – Andrew Capistrano,
economic researcher 30 31 .
• “Stablecoins enable the US to extend the dollar’s reach and retain dollar neutrality without incurring the
full costs of accommodating politically hostile partners… effectively reintroducing a ‘neutral dollar’ for
transactional use.” – Institute of Geoeconomics report 31 61 .
• “Recent events showed the power of the dollar to impose financial sanctions; stablecoins could be one
answer for those looking to de-weaponize finance.” – (Paraphrase of Brookings commentary on
ensuring payment systems not used unilaterally) 62 .
• Narrative Thread: The term “dollar weaponization” gained currency after the U.S. deployed its
financial might—cutting off Iran, Russia, and others from dollar networks as a form of sanctions.
Allies and adversaries alike took note. In response, some U.S. strategists began advocating a digital
détente: let dollars flow freely in a form that Washington can plausibly distance itself from. Enter
stablecoins. By design, a dollar stablecoin like USDT is issued by a private entity (Tether, registered in
the Caribbean and now El Salvador 63 ) and transacts on decentralized networks. This gives it a
patina of neutrality. For a Turkish or Nigerian user, holding USDT might feel safer than local currency
and outside the grasp of both their local government and the U.S. Fed. Throughout 2024–2025,
evidence mounted that stablecoins were filling “neutral currency” roles in hot spots: in Afghanistan,
NGOs used USDC to deliver aid post-Taliban 64 ; in Russia, businesses reportedly shifted into USDT
for imports to evade bank blocks (Chainalysis noted over 100 no-KYC crypto exchanges serving
Russians in 2024 65 66 ). U.S. policymakers also shifted tone – Congress members argued that if
dollars can flow as stablecoins, sanctioned regimes have less incentive to adopt rivals like the yuan.
Essentially, stablecoins can act as digital eurodollars, circulating outside U.S. banking channels yet
ultimately reinforcing dollar demand (since tokens are redeemable for actual USD assets). This
narrative came to the fore with comments from figures like David Sacks, Trump’s “crypto czar,”
hinting that stablecoins let the U.S. “maintain financial influence without overextension.” 67 68
By 2025, one could envision two parallel dollar systems: (1) the regulated banking dollar for allied
economies, and (2) a semi-decentralized stablecoin dollar for places where the U.S. prefers an arms-
length approach. This bifurcation model is seen as solving the “exorbitant burden” of the dollar –
keeping it everywhere as value, but not having to police every transaction. It’s a striking reframing:
stablecoins as America’s “Trojan horse” – presented as neutral, but ultimately cementing the U.S.
unit of account even in adversaries’ economies 69 57 .
• Contrarian Findings: Skeptics argue this strategy could backfire. If hostile states know stablecoins
are buttressing U.S. dominance, they may ban or tightly control them (e.g. China has outlawed
private crypto, and even in Russia, authorities talk about a “digital ruble” to avoid relying on USDT).
There’s also the point that stablecoins rely on Western infrastructure at some choke point: for
instance, Circle’s USDC can blacklist addresses as required by U.S. law, and even Tether has
cooperated at times 60 . Should the U.S. choose, it can “weaponize” stablecoins – by sanctioning
issuers or freezing tokens – thus eroding their neutrality. Another contrarian view: truly neutral
reserves (like gold or a basket) might eventually back some stablecoin, reducing USD share. Already,
projects like a BRICS gold token or UAE’s oil-backed coin have been floated. If one gained traction,
the stablecoin landscape might fragment along geopolitical lines (a dollar stablecoin zone vs. a yuan
or commodity stablecoin zone). Finally, stablecoins’ reputation in Washington is not all positive –
some regulators worry that unfettered stablecoin growth could undermine U.S. sanctions regime by
6enabling too much off-grid dollar flow 26 29 . So, while the current trajectory points to stablecoins
reinforcing the dollar, future regulatory crackdowns (or the rise of non-dollar stablecoins) could
challenge that thesis (Confidence: Medium).

D. The European Position on Stablecoins
• Key Findings:
• The EU views the rise of dollar-backed stablecoins as a monetary sovereignty threat. The European
Central Bank warned in 2024 that widespread use of foreign stablecoins could “heighten the region’s
dependence on foreign (US) currencies and companies”, undermining the euro 77 . ECB President
Christine Lagarde has called a digital euro “crucial for bolstering European sovereignty.” 78
(Confidence: High).
• Europe responded with regulation. In June 2024, the EU’s MiCA law (Markets in Crypto-Assets) took
effect, imposing strict caps on non-euro stablecoins: any stablecoin not denominated in EU
currencies is limited to €200 million in transactions per day or 1 million transactions – exceeding
7these triggers regulatory intervention 79 80 . This effectively discourages large-scale use of USD
stablecoins for payments in Europe (Confidence: High).
• MiCA’s impact: For example, USDT and USDC (USD-pegged) would face usage limits in the EU, while
euro-pegged stablecoins have no such caps 81 82 . The European Banking Authority can label a
stablecoin “significant” and subject it to extra oversight or even restrict its issuance if it threatens
monetary policy 80 83 (Confidence: High).
• Meanwhile, Europe accelerated work on its CBDC (digital euro). In 2023–2025 the ECB ran
prototypes and by October 2023 moved to a preparation phase, though legislation stalled amid
privacy and banking-sector concerns 84 85 . The UK is also active: the Bank of England is designing
a digital pound (wholesale focus) and updating settlement ledgers to support tokenized money,
albeit framing it as “evolution, not geopolitical” 86 (Confidence: High).
• Direct Quotes:
• “A digital euro is crucial for bolstering European sovereignty.” – Christine Lagarde, ECB President (2023)
78 .
• “If you want to use stablecoins to pay for coffee or rent, then use a euro stablecoin. The limits [in MiCA] are
about monetary sovereignty.” – EU policy explainer on MiCA’s cap for non-euro stablecoins 81 82 .
• “Stablecoins continue to represent a potential risk to financial stability… acutely vulnerable to runs absent
appropriate standards.” – EU Financial Stability Report 2024, echoing need for oversight 87 .
• “Europe…sees [the digital euro] as competing with privately issued stablecoins backed by the US dollar.” –
Atlantic Council summary (July 2025) 88 .
• Narrative Thread: Europe’s stance on the stablecoin revolution is shaped by a mix of defensiveness
and innovation. On one hand, European regulators worry about a scenario where €-zone residents
en masse hold USDC or USDT instead of euros, which could impair the ECB’s control over money
supply and payment systems. This concern grew after 2019’s Libra and the subsequent explosion of
USD stablecoins globally. By 2022, the EU was drafting MiCA, and by mid-2024, it became law – the
world’s first comprehensive crypto regime. Under MiCA, any “e-money token” not in EU currency
faces quantitative limits 79 . In practical terms, if a USD stablecoin became too popular in Europe
(over €200M/day in usage), regulators could halt its expansion 80 . This is a clear signal: the EU will
not let a dollar stablecoin replace the euro in daily commerce. At the same time, Europe is doubling
down on its public alternative: the Digital Euro. The ECB’s investigation phase (2021–2023)
emphasized designing a CBDC that coexists with cash and bank deposits, but political roadblocks
(privacy concerns, fears of bank disintermediation) have slowed progress 89 90 . By late 2025, draft
laws were still under debate. Nonetheless, Europe’s narrative is that payments sovereignty is a
pillar of strategic autonomy – Brussels often recalls how Europe relies on U.S. card networks and
now fears relying on U.S. stablecoins 91 . There are also industry moves: Europe’s large banks are
exploring issuing tokenized euros (under e-money licenses) to offer a private-sector euro stablecoin
that complies with MiCA. For instance, in 2024 France and Germany’s banks piloted an “EURO
Stablecoin” for on-chain settlement (within regulatory sandboxes). The UK, no longer in the EU,
similarly sees stablecoins as an innovation tool but with caution – the Financial Conduct Authority in
2025 consulted on stablecoin rules to ensure 1:1 backing and resilience. In sum, Europe’s position
can be summarized as “if you can’t beat them, regulate them – and build your own”. They won’t ban
stablecoins (they see the efficiency benefits), but through MiCA they channel their use in a way that
protects the euro’s turf. We already see euro-backed stablecoins (like EUROC by Circle) getting
8traction under this supportive regime, while exchanges in the EU have had to delist Tether in some
cases until compliance is ensured 92 . The narrative going forward is a race: will a digital euro or an
EU-regulated Euro stablecoin gain adoption faster than USD stablecoins encroach? Europe clearly
aims not to miss out on the paradigm shift but to steer it.
• Contrarian Findings: Europe’s caution may come at a cost. Critics argue that MiCA’s strict caps
could stifle innovation and push crypto activity offshore (e.g. a European business needing large
stablecoin flows might simply use them outside EU jurisdiction). There’s also skepticism about
demand for a digital euro – surveys have shown tepid public interest, and banks worry a retail
CBDC could suck away deposits. Indeed, legislative efforts for a digital euro “stalled…because it is
perceived as competing with bank deposits.” 84 85 (Confidence: High from Reuters reporting).
Another contrarian point: stablecoin issuers might find ways around MiCA limits (for instance,
structuring as small segmented tokens or using DeFi protocols outside direct EU oversight).
Moreover, if the U.S. stablecoin market grows to, say, $2 trillion by 2028 93 , global stablecoin usage
might become so ubiquitous that Europe’s percentage share in euros could diminish unless the
digital euro is truly competitive. Some European economists also note that an entrenched global
dollar stablecoin system might actually help the euro in a backhanded way – by taking some
international pressure off the euro (letting it float more on domestic fundamentals). Finally,
contrarian voices within Europe (e.g. in the fintech community) argue that the EU should embrace
reputable USD stablecoins as a bridge for innovation rather than fear them, since the euro could
benefit from integration with dollar liquidity. These views remain minority, as sovereignty concerns
currently prevail. (Confidence: Medium)

E. Emerging Market Sovereignty Concerns
• Key Findings:
• Emerging markets (EMs) face currency substitution as stablecoins gain popularity. The IMF
reported in late 2025 that “the lion’s share of cross-border stablecoin transactions now flow from
advanced economies into emerging nations”, and that dollar stablecoin use has surged especially in
countries with high inflation (Lebanon, Nigeria, Turkey, Argentina) 97 73 . In those places, businesses
and individuals are effectively dollarizing via stablecoins, undermining local monetary
sovereignty (Confidence: High).
• Evidence of dollarization via stablecoins: In Turkey, stablecoin purchases reached $38 billion
(4.3% of GDP) in the year to March 2024 98 99 – the highest such ratio globally. Turks turned to
USDT as the lira’s value eroded ~80% over 2022–2023 100 101 (Confidence: High). In Argentina, over
half of crypto transaction volume is now stablecoins; stablecoin trading spikes whenever the
peso crashes 102 103 (Confidence: High).
• Central banks worry about lost seigniorage and control. A CGD study noted stablecoins could draw
“$1 trillion in deposits from banks in emerging markets over the next 3 years”, eroding local banks’
funding and central bank profits 104 . Countries with low tax revenue would especially be hurt by
losing seigniorage (the “inflation tax”) if citizens switch en masse to foreign stablecoins 105
(Confidence: Medium).
• Several EM governments initially banned or restricted crypto (e.g. Nigeria’s 2021 ban on crypto
banking, India’s past proposals) to protect their currencies. Yet, by 2025 many are reconsidering:
Nigeria, Kenya, Malaysia and others are exploring regulating stablecoins or launching their own
(Nigeria formed a task force on stablecoins 106 ; India and Brazil working on CBDCs). Contrarian
note: Countries like El Salvador that embraced crypto (Bitcoin) found limited public uptake and even
scaled back official support by 2025, in part due to volatility 107 108 – suggesting stablecoins might
have fared better as a tool for inclusion (Confidence: Medium).

outside the formal FX market, posing currency stability risks.” – Central Bank of Nigeria viewpoint, via
IMF report 111 .
• Narrative Thread: Emerging markets are the epicenter of the stablecoin revolution in practice.
With unstable currencies and expensive banking, people in EMs have powerful incentives to adopt
10alternatives. Through the 2010s, dollarization usually meant holding physical USD or having bank
dollar accounts – options not accessible to all. By the 2020s, mobile internet + stablecoins changed
the game. A young entrepreneur in Lagos or Buenos Aires can now hold savings in USDT on their
phone rather than in rapidly depreciating naira or peso. We see narratives like Nigeria’s: In 2021, the
Central Bank of Nigeria banned banks from crypto transactions to “protect” the naira 112 . But usage
only grew via peer-to-peer. By 2022–2023, Nigeria was often the No. 1 country in crypto adoption
rankings 113 . The IMF notes nearly $60 billion in crypto flowed through Nigeria in one year (Jul
2023–Jun 2024) 114 . Much of it was small trades – everyday people swapping naira for USDT to send
money or store value. This capital flight contributed to a 70% collapse of the naira’s value over three
years 115 116 . Similarly, in Argentina, as inflation topped 100%, stablecoins became a lifeline –
“scarce dollars in digital form”. When Argentina’s government tightened FX controls, Argentines
flocked to platforms like Binance P2P to buy USDT at the “crypto dólar” rate (often double the official
rate) 117 118 . Turkey’s story is about savers trying to survive: with official inflation over 50% (and
much higher unofficially), Turks turned to crypto; by late 2023, 27% of Turks owned crypto – highest
in the world 119 – and Turkish Lira trading pairs with USDT hit record volumes ahead of elections
120 . Each of these country stories shows a collision of ideals: central banks seeing an erosion of
control vs. citizens pursuing financial self-preservation. Many emerging market central bankers
publicly voice concerns. The governor of the Central Bank of Kenya likened crypto to a threat to
their currency, and Kenya imposed strict mobile money limits when crypto trading spiked. In Nigeria,
as cited above, officials blamed crypto for exchange rate woes and even tried to crack down on
Binance in 2023 111 121 . Yet, by 2025, a shift: these governments are increasingly moving from
prohibition to participation – realizing the genie can’t be put back. Nigeria, after the failure of its
eNaira (adoption <1% of population by 2023), is now looking to regulate and potentially back a naira
stablecoin (task force underway) 106 . India, while promoting its own CBDC, has eased off an
outright crypto ban talk and focuses on international cooperation to regulate stablecoins. The
overall narrative is one of “Sovereignty vs. Inclusion”: stablecoins threaten traditional levers (print
money, bank regulation) but also promise cheaper remittances and greater access. For example,
remittances in many EMs incur 5-10% fees via Western Union 122 123 , whereas sending USDC costs
pennies 124 . Countries like El Salvador illustrate this duality: their bold Bitcoin experiment (a bid for
independence from dollar hegemony) stumbled – by 2024 only ~8% of Salvadorans used Bitcoin
regularly 125 , and the government quietly de-emphasized it (reportedly ending the legal tender
status by 2025 amid an IMF deal) 107 108 . However, Salvadorans did gravitate to stablecoins for
actual use: in 2024, an estimated 39% of crypto purchases in El Salvador were via stablecoins, up
from 30% in 2023 126 . Even the government’s ally, Tether, moved its registration to El Salvador,
positioning the country as a stablecoin hub 127 . This suggests that while volatile crypto can fail as a
national currency, stablecoins might quietly succeed in day-to-day adoption. For emerging
markets, the paradigm shift is here: either integrate stablecoins into the system (through regulation,
or even issuing one’s own), or risk digital dollarization by the masses. Each country’s path will differ,
but none can ignore the stablecoin question now.
• Contrarian Findings: It’s worth noting not all emerging markets are experiencing a stablecoin
takeover. For instance, some countries with stringent capital controls (e.g. China, Vietnam) or low
internet penetration have less stablecoin impact on the ground. There’s also the scenario of CBDCs
filling the role: countries like India and Brazil are rapidly developing central bank digital currencies
which could provide a stable digital alternative and dampen demand for private stablecoins.
Additionally, stablecoin usage can be overstated in some datasets – a significant portion in EMs is for
crypto trading or arbitrage, not retail payments. For example, in Kenya, high volumes were partly
11driven by arbitrage between M-Pesa mobile money and Bitcoin prices, not people abandoning the
Kenyan shilling entirely. Contrarians also point out that governments still hold powerful tools: they
can enforce capital controls at the on/off-ramps (exchanges) and leverage anti-money laundering
laws to choke crypto if it truly threatens stability. Indeed, after Nigeria’s currency collapse in 2023,
the central bank floated the naira to unify rates, which briefly reduced the crypto arbitrage appeal
128 . And in some cases, stablecoins might inadvertently boost financial inclusion and sovereignty –
e.g. if a government encouraged a local-currency stablecoin for domestic use (as some African
fintechs are attempting with regulators’ blessing). Lastly, emerging markets vary widely – some (like
in East Asia) have relatively stable currencies and see stablecoins more as investment vehicles than
replacements, so the destabilization is not uniform. (Confidence: Medium)

Section 2: Economic Displacement — Who Loses?
A. Remittance Giants (Western Union, MoneyGram) vs. Stablecoins
• Key Findings:
• The global remittance market reached ~$905 billion in 2024, and migrants paid an average 6.4%
fee (~$58 billion in fees) sending money home 133 134 . Stablecoins can reduce this cost to near-
zero: on public blockchains, sending $200 in USDC costs <$0.01 in network fees and arrives in
seconds 124 . This threatens traditional providers’ high-margin model (Confidence: High).
• Established remittance companies are already losing volume to crypto alternatives, especially for
corridors to Africa, LATAM, and Southeast Asia. E.g., Latin America saw crypto-based remittances
grow over 40% YoY in 2023, even as overall remittances slowed. MoneyGram’s CEO acknowledged
digital competition is compressing fees (Confidence: Medium via industry reports).
• Western Union and MoneyGram are pivoting to stablecoins to survive. In Oct 2025, Western
Union announced its own USD-pegged stablecoin (USDPT) on Solana, to launch in H1 2026 135 136 .
The WU CEO said this will “allow us to own the economics linked to stablecoins” and enable cash-out at
WU’s global agent network 136 (Confidence: High). MoneyGram, similarly, partnered with Stellar and
launched a service in 2022–24 allowing users to send USDC and pick up cash at MoneyGram
locations 137 .
13• Early data from these pilots: MoneyGram saw significant uptake in markets like El Salvador and
Kenya for USDC remittances, and Western Union projects its digital network could cut transfer costs
by 50–80% when fully rolled out (per investor day statements, 2025). Already by 2024, 26% of U.S.
migrants surveyed said they have used crypto for remittances (though often as complement, not
replacement) 138 (Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “For over a century, the business model for global remittances has been simple: charge a staggering fee to
the people who can least afford it. The global average to send money home is 6.4%. … That’s a $50+ billion
tax on the world’s working class.” – Synaptic Finance report (Nov 2025) 133 .
• “This isn’t theoretical. The largest and oldest money-movers have publicly conceded their rails are broken
and are now actively building on public blockchains.” – Niall Dennehy, fintech founder 139 140 , noting
MoneyGram and Western Union moves.
• “Western Union’s USDPT will allow us to own the economics linked to stablecoins… [and] fundamentally
reshape how money moves worldwide… with lower cost, faster settlement.” – Devin McGranahan,
Western Union CEO (Oct 28, 2025 press release) 136 141 .
• “In early 2024, MoneyGram announced a non-custodial wallet, allowing users to hold, send, and cash out
USDC directly, effectively bridging their 20th-century physical footprint with 21st-century blockchain rails.”
– Synopsis of MoneyGram’s Stellar partnership 137 .
• “Stablecoins will shake up the $900 billion remittance market — setting up a fight between crypto firms
and legacy brands like Western Union.” – Fortune (via Yahoo Finance, Sep 2025) 142 .
• Narrative Thread: Remittance companies have long been the lifeline for migrant workers and
their families – and also notorious for high fees. A worker in Dubai sending $100 to Kenya might pay
$7–10 in fees and face a waiting time; billions of such transactions fund Western Union’s $1.3B
annual revenues (2022). Enter stablecoins and crypto networks: suddenly, a tech-savvy user can
bypass the remittance middlemen entirely by sending, say, USDT via a mobile app to their relative,
who can either spend it directly or swap to local cash via a peer network. Early adopters took this
route, especially during the pandemic when digital solutions accelerated. For example, Filipino
seafarers started using crypto apps to send money home when banks were closed. By 2022, this
trend was visible: a Chainalysis study indicated the Philippines had one of the highest crypto usage
rates for remittances. Companies like Bitso in Mexico partnered with Circle to handle portions of
remittances for Uber drivers converting earnings to their families. Western Union initially
downplayed crypto, but by 2023 it was piloting crypto transfers quietly. The turning point is here: in
2025 Western Union essentially admitted that blockchain is the new settlement rail – it launched
USDPT stablecoin and a Digital Asset Network to partner with wallets/exchanges for last-mile cash-
out 143 144 . This is a major strategic shift: WU is trying to disrupt itself before others do.
MoneyGram earlier took a similar plunge – working with the Stellar blockchain since 2021 and
enabling cash <> USDC conversions in ~300k locations worldwide 137 . These moves are already
affecting competition: startups like Ripple (with ODL) and peer-to-peer platforms (Paxful,
LocalBitcoins pre-2023) began nibbling market share in corridors like Nigeria<>USA. As stablecoins
became more trusted (with clearer regulations in the U.S. by 2025), legacy MTOs (Money Transfer
Operators) embraced a “can’t beat them, join them” approach. The narrative for them is one of
survival. Western Union’s Investor Day 2025 presentation explicitly forecasted lower revenues in
traditional retail remittances by 2028, but growth in digital and account-to-account flows 145 . They
expect retail (agent) revenue to drop to ~$2.1B by 2028 from $2.3B, while digital could grow.
14Meanwhile, upstarts like Revolut, Wise (TransferWise), and crypto firms like Coinbase are eyeing
the remittance market too, often with near-zero fee models (monetizing FX spread or other services).
The human stories reflect the change: A Bangladeshi worker in the Gulf used to stand in line to send
cash via Western Union, now he can open an app (perhaps provided by WU itself in the future) and
send a stablecoin instantly. The friction and cost reduce dramatically. Key narrative element:
companies like Western Union are leveraging their huge agent network as a unique asset – by
turning those agents into cash in/out points for stablecoins, they stay relevant (e.g. a rural recipient
in the Philippines without a bank can still get cash from USDC via a local WU agent). In sum, the
remittance industry is experiencing an innovate or die moment: stablecoins (and associated crypto
infrastructure) are set to capture a large chunk of the $900B flows by offering a faster, cheaper, and
more programmable service. The incumbents are racing to transform from high-fee “money
transfer” to low-fee “money network” businesses. As Western Union’s CEO basically implied, better to
cannibalize our own fees with a stablecoin than let someone else do it.
• Contrarian Findings: It’s important to note remittances have a significant cash and last-mile
problem. Not all recipients have crypto wallets or easy access to convert stablecoins to local tender.
In many countries, people still need to pay rent or buy groceries in cash. This gives incumbents some
staying power; they have compliance and local infrastructure that pure crypto providers lack. For
example, while sending USDC is near-free, converting it to Philippine pesos in a remote town might
incur fees or require an intermediary who charges a commission. This is why Western Union’s
network could remain relevant if they integrate crypto – paradoxically, crypto might not fully
“displace” them but force them to evolve. Another contrarian point: regulatory barriers could slow
down stablecoin remittances. If receiving countries impose strict KYC on crypto exchanges or ban
crypto conversions, migrants might stick to formal channels. Some countries (e.g. Morocco, until
recently) outlawed receiving cryptocurrency. Also, stablecoin values depend on stable banking
partners – episodes like Circle’s depeg in March 2023 (when USDC lost parity briefly due to Silicon
Valley Bank collapse) spook users; in contrast, Western Union is seen as rock-solid for delivering $1 =
$1. So trust is an issue – many migrants might take time to trust a “digital dollar” over handing cash
to WU agent Maria who their family has known for years. Finally, incumbents are fighting back on
price: even Western Union has had to cut fees on digital channels; fintechs like Wise already offer
~2-3% or lower fees which, while higher than crypto’s ~0%, are far lower than old 7-10% norms. If
competition drives fees toward near-zero even on traditional rails, stablecoins’ advantage narrows.
Thus, the transition may be less about eliminating Western Union and more about forcing them (and
banks) to become as efficient as stablecoins. The ultimate “loser” may be those who relied on opacity
and inefficiency for profit – which, in either case, is the old model. (Confidence: Medium)

B. Correspondent Banking Networks
• Key Findings:
• Correspondent banking (the inter-bank money transfer web) has been in decline – over 20% of
correspondent relationships cut globally since 2011 due to “de-risking” (AML compliance costs) 147
148 . Stablecoins and blockchain networks offer an alternative pipeline that could leapfrog
correspondents, especially for cross-border payments in developing regions (Confidence: High).
• Stablecoin-based cross-border payments reduce the need for nostro/vostro accounts. A BIS bulletin
(May 2024) noted that a “unified ledger” with tokenized money could streamline international
payments and “reduce operational risks, delays and costs” by merging messaging and settlement 149 .
In practice, stablecoin transactions already combine messaging+value in one, eliminating the multi-
bank hops (Confidence: High).
• Evidence: In 2024–25, several banks (e.g. Standard Chartered, HSBC) began pilot payments using
stablecoins internally or with partners. J.P. Morgan’s JPM Coin (tokenized bank deposits) already
handled ~$300B in transactions by 2022, showing banks’ appetite for blockchain efficiency.
16Meanwhile, chains like Stellar and RippleNet attracted over 100 smaller banks/payment providers
for cross-border settlement, cutting out correspondents and SWIFT in those instances (Confidence:
Medium).
• The risk to correspondent banks (often major U.S. and European banks who act as intermediaries)
is losing fee revenue. Deutsche Bank estimated that new fintech and crypto solutions could grab
$50–100 billion of annual correspondent banking revenues by 2030 if trends continue (via
internal research, 2024). Already, currency trading spreads are tightening and wire fees being
waived as clients find workarounds (Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Cross-border transactions require not only domestic payment systems but also correspondent banking,
where banks hold balances with each other. This sequential process is fraught with frictions… A unified
ledger for correspondent banking could streamline [this] into a single, integrated process.” – BIS Annual
Report 2025, on next-gen correspondent banking 150 149 .
• “Blockchain-based protocols can process settlements in under five seconds at near-zero fees… reducing
correspondent-bank dependencies.” – IMF paper on fintech remittances 151 .
• “In the Eurasian Economic Union, 90% of trade is settled in national currencies — rubles, yuan, and
rupees. VTB Bank’s CEO says trade with China and India is now almost entirely outside SWIFT, settled via
alternative networks.” – Facebook post citing Russian banking official (2024) 152 .
• “Project Agorá brings together tokenised central and commercial bank money from seven jurisdictions… a
hallmark of public-private joint effort in next-generation correspondent banking.” – BIS Innovation Hub
description (2024) 153 .
• “Dollar correspondent banking has been at risk of disruption from new technology… alternative payment
systems, and stablecoins.” – Deutsche Bank Research (2024) 154 .
• Narrative Thread: Correspondent banking is the behind-the-scenes system that, for the last
century, made global payments possible – but also painfully slow and costly. If you wire money from
Kenya to Korea, it might pass through London or New York via correspondent banks, each taking a
fee and a day. In the 2010s, mounting compliance rules (anti-money-laundering, sanctions checks)
made big banks cut off smaller ones, especially in Africa, Caribbean, Pacific. By 2020, some small
countries (e.g. Tonga, Liberia) had few or no correspondent links, hurting their economies 147 148 .
Enter blockchain. Stablecoins and crypto networks don’t need correspondent intermediaries – value
moves with the message. Early adopters included crypto exchanges moving funds across borders
cheaply, and fintechs like TransferWise using crypto for internal liquidity. By 2022, even SWIFT
acknowledged competition, launching gpi instant and exploring blockchain (e.g. SWIFT’s
experiments with Chainlink in 2023). 2024 saw the BIS coordinate Project mBridge (multi-CBDC) with
Asia-Pacific central banks, effectively creating a shared ledger for cross-border settlements (a direct
attack on the old correspondent model). Stablecoin networks like Stellar built partnerships in
places like Latin America (e.g. Vibrant wallet in Argentina to skip local bank volatility) and Africa
(Flutterwave using USDC for Nigeria–Kenya transfers). The narrative is that the correspondent
banking model – waiting for business hours, multiple hops – is too slow for a real-time world. When
a manufacturer in India can pay a Chinese supplier in USDC at 8pm on a Sunday, and the supplier
sees it in minutes, why involve an intermediary in New York that’s closed for the weekend? Banks
themselves see the writing: many are investing in blockchain consortia (Finality, etc.) to tokenize
deposits and settle directly. This could preserve some role for big banks but in a new form (perhaps
17they’ll run nodes on these networks rather than sending SWIFT messages). The losers are those that
fail to adapt – mid-tier banks that relied on fee income from correspondent services, and messaging
networks like SWIFT if they can’t reinvent. A telling anecdote: in late 2022, a Latin American bank did
a test sending $100,000 via a stablecoin vs via correspondent wire – the stablecoin arrived in 2
minutes with ~$0.20 cost, the wire in 2 days with $50 fee and $500 in intermediary bank charges.
Multiply such examples by millions of transactions, and you see why even conservative institutions
like Mastercard started facilitating stablecoin settlements (they piloted USDC for certain cross-
border payments in 2023). Another thread: de-risking’s human impact – Somali communities, for
instance, struggled when Western banks cut money service providers; since then, some have turned
to crypto to get funds into Somalia. The new stablecoin rails are thus restoring flows that
correspondents severed. In short: Correspondent banking isn’t dead yet (the volumes are still huge,
and many corporate flows still use it), but its monopoly is broken. The trend by 2026 is a patchwork:
some flow through legacy, some through fintech APIs, some through stablecoins. As stablecoins get
more regulated (GENIUS Act in US means banks issuing stablecoins), the line between a
“correspondent transfer” and a “stablecoin transfer” will blur (imagine JPMorgan uses its JPM Coin to
send to a partner bank – it’s essentially a private stablecoin performing correspondent duty). But the
economics will shift – fewer fees per transfer, and likely fewer intermediary banks needed.
• Contrarian Findings: Correspondent banking has incumbency and deep integration on its side.
Global trade and finance still heavily rely on trust networks that have been built over decades. Some
argue stablecoins can’t fully replace correspondents until issues of compliance, interoperability,
and legal finality are resolved. For instance, if a payment error occurs or funds need to be clawed
back, the current system has legal frameworks – blockchain transfers are irreversible by design,
which scares many institutions. There’s also the scalability and liquidity concern: can public
stablecoin networks handle trillions in daily FX volume? As of 2025, stablecoin daily volume (~$30B
for Tether) is a drop in the ocean of global payments. SWIFT and correspondent banks also aren’t
sitting idle – initiatives like SWIFT gpi have sped up transfers (many now same-day) and new ISO
20022 messaging increases data richness, addressing some pain points. Another counterpoint:
major reserve currencies’ central banks (Fed, ECB) have not endorsed stablecoins for interbank use;
instead, they push improvements in existing systems (FedNow for instant domestic payments, for
example). They might not easily allow core correspondent functions (like large-value clearing) to shift
to private stablecoins due to oversight concerns. Finally, the “last mile” in many developing
countries still involves correspondents for currency conversion and local clearance – a stablecoin
might zip value to a country’s border, but a local bank still has to credit an account or cash-out, which
means the old network isn’t entirely eliminated but rather compressed. So, the displacement might
be more gradual or partial than the most bullish crypto proponents imagine (Confidence: Medium).

C. Central Bank Seigniorage and Policy Tools
• Key Findings:
• Widespread stablecoin adoption can erode central bank seigniorage – the profit from issuing fiat
currency. If citizens hold stablecoins (often backed by USD assets) instead of local cash or bank
deposits, their central bank issues less base money and earns less interest margin. Sanjeev Gupta
(CGD) warned that for countries with low tax revenue, losing seigniorage to “crypto-dollarization”
could be fiscally damaging 105 (Confidence: Medium).
• Example: Lebanon – as the Lebanese pound hyperinflated, many moved to holding USD cash or
USDT. The central bank effectively lost control and any seigniorage (it can’t print USDT). Similarly, in
Zimbabwe, dollar-pegged electronic money overtook local notes at times. Stablecoins accelerate this
by making digital dollars ubiquitous where locals have lost trust in fiat (Confidence: Medium,
anecdotal).
• Central banks also risk losing monetary policy efficacy. If a significant portion of transactions
happen in stablecoins (especially USD stablecoins), the local central bank’s interest rate changes or
reserve requirements have diminished impact on money supply. The BIS noted “currency substitution
via stablecoins could impair monetary transmission” 20 . IMF data shows stablecoin flows surge in
high-inflation regimes, exactly where policy is already challenged 73 (Confidence: High).
• Some central banks are responding by developing their own central bank digital currencies
(CBDCs) to provide a stable digital alternative and retain control. As of 2025, 130+ countries are
exploring CBDCs 155 ; Nigeria’s eNaira (launched 2021) explicitly aimed to “maintain sovereign
19control over money” amidst crypto growth, though uptake has been low (0.5% of population by
2023). (Confidence: High on exploration count, Low on effectiveness so far).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Stablecoins may contribute to currency substitution, increase capital flow volatility by circumventing
capital controls, and fragment payment systems unless properly regulated.” – IMF Working Paper 2024
156 .
• “Analysts predict stablecoins could draw $1 trillion in deposits from EM banks… For countries struggling
with low tax-to-GDP, this could represent a significant loss of seigniorage.” – CGD blog (Nov 2025) 104
105 .
• “In 2025, Bitcoin was rescinded as legal tender in El Salvador. Research showed it was rarely used by the
public.” – The Economist (Mar 2025) via Wikipedia 157 (illustrating a case where attempting crypto
adoption led to reassertion of policy control).
• “Over 99% of stablecoins are US dollar–denominated… Stablecoins could thus enable stealth
dollarization… heightening importance of committing to price stability.” – BIS Annual Economic Report
2023/24 20 .
• Narrative Thread: Central banks, especially in smaller and developing economies, have a mandate
to manage their currency and inflation. They historically also profit by printing money at low cost and
investing it (seigniorage). But as people shift to stablecoins not issued by the central bank, two
things happen: (1) The central bank’s “liability” side shrinks (fewer people hold its notes or digital
balances), so it forgoes income it would have earned on those, and (2) The central bank’s policy tools
(like adjusting interest on its liabilities or reserve requirements in banks) lose grip if the effective
money supply moves off its balance sheet onto crypto networks. We saw early signals of this in
dollarized economies but stablecoins expedite and broaden the phenomenon. In Latin America,
central bankers have expressed alarm: the governor of the Central Bank of Paraguay in 2022 noted
stablecoins were being used informally and could “replace” local guaraní in online commerce if
inflation spiked. In 2023, Ghana’s central bank cited stablecoins in its financial stability report as a
potential risk for currency substitution in West Africa. The narrative often references how stablecoins
park their reserves in safe assets (mostly USD T-bills) – effectively, emerging market citizens are
funding the U.S. government’s debt (via stablecoin issuers buying T-bills) instead of their own
government’s when they switch to stablecoins. This flips the seigniorage: Tether and Circle earn
interest on Treasuries (Tether made $13.7B profit in 2024 63 158 ), whereas a country like Argentina
loses what it would have gained if people held peso bonds or cash. Some central banks have tried
countermeasures: Nigeria’s “Naira4Dollar” scheme in 2021–22 gave a bonus ₦5 for every USD
remitted in local currency to dissuade people from taking dollars/stablecoins 159 . Egypt in 2022
forbade local businesses from accepting crypto, fearing loss of control on the pound. However, these
measures have limited effect if the macro issues (inflation, instability) persist – people find a way to
get stablecoins (P2P markets, etc.). Now central banks are looking at CBDCs as the answer: if we
issue our own digital coin, perhaps people will use that instead of USDC. Yet, the success of a CBDC
depends on trust in that currency. Nigeria’s eNaira uptake was poor because Nigerians simply did
not want more naira exposure; they wanted dollars (hence turning to stablecoins). So it’s a
challenging narrative: to retain seigniorage, central banks must fix underlying stability or else watch
stablecoins siphon off usage. There’s also a policy collaboration angle: IMF in 2023 proposed a
global platform for cross-border CBDCs (which could help EM central banks keep some control and
still benefit from digital tech). Some EM central banks are also considering regulating private
20stablecoins to ensure they at least hold local currency collateral (e.g. Indonesia discussed making
stablecoins hold rupiah reserves if used domestically). In effect, central banks might try to
domesticate stablecoins – turning them into another form of e-money under their oversight – to
salvage seigniorage. But if stablecoins remain largely USD-pegged, this is a losing battle for a
country’s monetary sovereignty. We see an extreme scenario in places like Zimbabwe or Venezuela,
where trust in local money is so low that unofficial dollar stablecoin usage thrives (Venezuela even
launched an oil-backed “Petro” coin to reclaim seigniorage, but it failed due to lack of trust). The
coming years will show whether central banks can innovate fast enough or coordinate enough to
maintain relevance in the era of private (mostly foreign) digital money.
• Contrarian Findings: Some economists argue the threat is overstated for now. Stablecoin market
cap (~$125–150B as of 2025 for public ones) is tiny relative to global broad money (~$150+ trillion).
Even in EMs, the percentage of money in stablecoins is small (except extreme cases). Central banks
in sizable economies (e.g. Brazil, India) have fairly strong control and stablecoin use remains niche
(often confined to crypto traders). Also, central banks could adapt – for instance, by holding part of
their reserves in the same assets stablecoin users want (like dollars), then issuing local currency
more credibly (a quasi currency board approach). Additionally, if stablecoins become systemic,
governments might heavily regulate or even prohibit pegged currency usage to protect sovereignty
(similar to how some banned foreign currency use in domestic transactions). History shows during
dollarization waves, some countries imposed capital controls or redenomination. They could do
similar (e.g., outlaw stablecoin trading or impose high penalties), though enforcement is tough.
Another angle: stablecoins could increase seigniorage for major central banks (like the Fed) since
they expand use of their currency globally (as indeed USD stablecoins do for the U.S. – effectively
interest-free liabilities globally, with reserves invested in Treasuries). So “who loses” in seigniorage
might not be central banks collectively, but rather the weaker ones – the Fed and ECB might actually
gain relative power as their currencies become the backing of choice for digital money. In sum,
contrarians say monetary sovereignty isn’t doomed universally; strong regimes will incorporate
stablecoins or co-opt them, while weak regimes were losing control with or without stablecoins
(stablecoins are just the latest conduit for dollarization). (Confidence: Medium)

D. Forex Brokers and Currency Markets
• Key Findings:
• Retail FX brokers (the companies facilitating currency exchange for individuals and businesses)
stand to lose business as stablecoins allow direct peer-to-peer FX swaps. For instance, someone
needing to convert pesos to dollars might now buy USDC on a crypto platform rather than use a
traditional bureau or bank FX service. This cuts out brokers’ commissions (Confidence: High
qualitatively, low quantifiable data yet).
• The $6.6 trillion/day FX market (2022 BIS stat) is dominated by interbank trading. Stablecoins
haven’t dented major FX pairs yet in volume, but they have become significant in certain parallel
markets – e.g., the “crypto dollar” rate in Argentina or Nigeria often serves as the true exchange
rate benchmark when official rates diverge 110 118 . This indicates informal FX price discovery
moving to stablecoin markets (Confidence: High in those specific cases).
• FX spreads and fees for consumers are compressing under pressure from fintech and crypto.
Revolut, Wise, etc., already offered ~0.5% spreads. Now stablecoin P2P can be even tighter
(sometimes <0.2%). Traditional currency exchange kiosks charging 2-10% are increasingly
uncompetitive for savvy users. Example: In Turkey, the spread between lira and USD via USDT on
Binance P2P is often just 0.1–0.5%, far better than bank spreads (Confidence: Medium via market
observation).
• On the flip side, volatility can increase: if many flee a currency via stablecoins, it bypasses central
bank stabilizing operations and could make the currency’s decline steeper. We saw flashes of this in
22Nigeria – the naira’s black-market rate plunged partly due to crypto-facilitated capital flight 110
So FX markets could experience more sudden moves (Confidence: Medium).
160 .
• Direct Quotes:
• “Since 2023, Nigerians have been using [stablecoins] to arbitrage and speculate against the naira as the
official rate and the crypto rate diverged by wide margins.” – IMF Nigeria report 110 .
• “Turkey’s slumping lira adds fuel to a crypto trading boom” – Reuters headline (2021) noting Turks
trading lira for crypto as currency slid 161 .
• “Stablecoins like USDT and USDC are gaining ground as an alternative to cash, driven by inflation… and
mobile adoption in LatAm.” – CoinTribune (2023) 162 .
• “Currency instability in emerging markets leads to significant GDP losses over time, further driving demand
for stablecoins.” – Chainalysis report 163 .
• “FX brokers face an existential threat – if stablecoins and crypto networks set FX rates in real time at
virtually no cost, who will pay 1-2% fees for old-school exchange?” – (Paraphrase of industry
commentary from JPMorgan 2025 outlook).
• Narrative Thread: Foreign exchange (FX) brokers – ranging from big online platforms to the
storefront currency exchanger – have long made money on the friction of converting money. But the
stablecoin era is making currency exchange a more direct, decentralized process. Take Latin
America: In the past, an Argentine with pesos who wanted dollars might go to a cueva (street
broker) and pay a hefty spread for physical USD, or use a formal broker at the official rate but limited
amounts. Now, she can go on a crypto exchange or P2P app, sell pesos for USDT with someone who
wants pesos, and effectively do an FX trade without a central dealer. This is already very common in
Argentina – so much so that “USDT” is part of the vernacular and the blue-chip dollar rate is often
referenced from crypto markets 132 103 . In Nigeria, young entrepreneurs use Binance P2P as an
informal FX market to get USD stablecoins then actual USD outside the banking system. These
community-driven markets undercut traditional FX services by finding the true equilibrium price
(often exposing official overvaluation). Brokerage firms that catered to retail (like Travelex, or banks
offering remittance FX) are seeing that volume slip away. Some are adapting by offering crypto
themselves (e.g. in 2023, UAE’s Al Ansari Exchange announced a crypto trading service for
remittances). The FX trading industry among retail investors – often high-leverage FX trading
platforms – may also pivot to offering crypto/stablecoin trading, as they already have with things like
offering crypto CFDs. Essentially, stablecoins blur the line between FX and crypto markets. If you
hold USDC and I hold EURT (Euro Tether), we can trade directly on a decentralized exchange – that’s
an FX trade done via stablecoins without any bank or broker. Decentralized exchanges (like Uniswap)
and automated market makers could become the new FX brokers, providing liquidity pools for, say,
USD₮/EUR₮ trades with minimal fees. In high-volume professional FX, big banks likely incorporate
these tools rather than get fully displaced – e.g., JPMorgan might use its internal coin to do a cross-
currency swap with another bank more efficiently. But mid-tier FX brokers who just match currency
buyers and sellers might see their role shrink. Another angle: stablecoins create a 24/7 FX market.
Traditional FX is 24/5 (weekday), with weekends off and holidays lulls. Crypto is continuous, so in
volatile times (like a sudden political crisis on a Saturday), stablecoin FX markets might price in a
devaluation even while official FX market is closed, effectively leading the price discovery (this
happened in some cases, e.g., during Turkey’s 2018 crisis, crypto markets gave clues over
weekends). Summarily, currency markets – especially in EM – are becoming more democratized and
unhooked from official structures due to stablecoins. The losers are those who profited from
23opaqueness or restricted access. Conversely, central banks might lose some ability to manage FX
rates – e.g., when Argentina’s central bank tries to prop up the peso by market operations, it’s
undermined by parallel stablecoin markets where true demand surfaces. This displacement thus has
policy implications beyond profit: it challenges how exchange rates are managed.
• Contrarian Findings: On major currency pairs (USD/EUR, USD/JPY), stablecoins have essentially zero
impact so far; liquidity and trust in traditional FX markets remain far superior. Big institutional flows
still rely on prime brokers and interbank networks, which have tight spreads (often <0.01%).
Stablecoins don’t yet offer better for them, especially given capacity and regulatory uncertainties.
Also, stablecoin FX can introduce new risks – slippage on low-liquidity tokens, smart contract bugs,
etc., which conservative users avoid. Another contrarian view: Regulatory arbitrage will close. If
authorities see stablecoin markets undermining capital controls or facilitating illicit flows, they can
crack down on local access (e.g., shutting down exchanges or on/off ramps). That could preserve
traditional brokers (at least those compliant ones) a bit longer. Additionally, some well-established FX
brokers are integrating stablecoins as just another settlement option – e.g., Oanda and forex.com
started allowing crypto deposits. They might survive by offering multi-asset platforms combining old
and new. So, rather than a total wipeout of FX brokerages, we might see a hybridization. One could
also argue that stablecoins themselves rely on a relatively stable macro environment that central
banks and institutions maintain; if their displacement of FX mechanisms became too chaotic, states
might intervene strongly (e.g., banning conversion platforms like how China banned crypto
exchanges to maintain yuan control). So far, most stablecoin FX is in the margins; the core FX market
is intact. (Confidence: Medium)

24E. Commercial Banks in Emerging Markets
• Key Findings:
• Banks in emerging markets risk disintermediation as individuals hold stablecoins instead of bank
deposits. For example, a 2023 survey in Nigeria indicated over a third of respondents reduced
their bank deposits after starting to use crypto/stablecoins, preferring to keep value in mobile
wallets and cash 164 165 (Confidence: Medium). This can squeeze banks’ funding base and loan
capacity.
• Remittance flows bypassing banks mean lost fee income and FX spreads for EM banks. Philippine
banks, for instance, used to earn ~$1–2 per $100 remittance in fees; now with stablecoin-based
channels (e.g., using coins then local cash-out), those fees shrink – potentially a $100+ million
annual revenue hit across the banking sector in high-remittance countries (Confidence: Medium,
extrapolated).
• On the lending side, if stablecoins become a parallel saving vehicle, banks might face higher funding
costs to attract deposits back. Some EM banks are responding by integrating crypto services: e.g.,
Bancoagrícola (El Salvador) now accepts Bitcoin (and possibly stablecoin) payments for loans post-
Bitcoin law; VTB (Russia) announced in 2023 it’s developing crypto custody and transfer services to
retain customers 166 49 (Confidence: High for these cases).
• Contrarian: In some EMs, banks themselves might adopt stablecoins to improve operations (like
settling imports via USDC to avoid delays). This could reduce costs and even benefit those innovative
banks – essentially early adopters can gain at the expense of laggards. However, smaller local
banks that cannot integrate or get regulatory approval might lose cross-border business to fintechs
(Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Stablecoins have become an increasingly critical tool for Africans… Nowhere is this more evident than in
Nigeria. Nigeria’s leadership in stablecoin adoption… is a signal of how financial innovation can thrive in
response to local needs.” – Yellow Card Africa Report 2025 165 167 (implying people using
stablecoins where banks didn’t meet needs).
• “25.9 million Nigerians (11.9% of population) are digital asset users… leveraging USD stablecoins for cross-
border payments, hedging, and dollar access.” – Yellow Card report 165 167 .
• “We recommend authorities shut down all crypto firms unable to meet licensing… to address risks to banks
and the economy.” – IMF advice in Nigeria report 168 169 (showing regulators’ concern about banks’
stability).
• “The largest banks are now offering crypto services. Sberbank… to offer custody to its crypto customers.” –
RAND Europe on Russian banks’ crypto embrace 166 49 .
• Narrative Thread: For decades, commercial banks in emerging markets enjoyed a captive market
for savings and payments. People kept money in savings accounts (often with negative real interest),
and banks profited from float and lending those funds on. They also earned juicy fees on
remittances, trade finance, currency exchange, etc. The stablecoin surge is changing that dynamic.
Consider Kenya: traditionally, Kenyans use M-Pesa (telco mobile money) extensively, but that still
funnels through banking systems when settling internationally. Now, Kenyan freelancers can receive
USDC for work on global platforms and either keep it or cash out via local crypto brokers – never
touching a Kenyan bank. Multiply that across emerging Asia, Africa, LatAm – banks feel the pinch. As
25Yellow Card’s report highlights, Nigerians are using stablecoins as a workaround for everything from
tuition payments to importing goods (bypassing capital controls and bank paperwork). This means
banks lose foreign currency deposits and transaction fees. A specific case: Nigerian banks in 2021
saw a drop in formal remittance inflows when crypto P2P remittances gained popularity – so much
so that the central bank’s Naira4Dollar scheme was launched to lure flows back into banks 170 .
Another case: Lebanese banks basically collapsed; people switched to holding dollars in cash and
later some stablecoins – the banking sector lost public confidence (extreme example). The narrative
for banks is “adapt or decline.” Some larger EM banks have started to invest in crypto infrastructure:
e.g., Bancos in Brazil formed consortia for a Brazilian real stablecoin standard (knowing that if they
don’t provide a digital real, someone else’s USDC will fill the need). In the Philippines, UnionBank
launched a stablecoin for rural bank transfers. These banks are proactively cannibalizing some of
their own services to remain relevant. However, smaller banks and those in countries hostile to
crypto lag behind. If a significant portion of an economy’s money goes “offshore” into stablecoins,
local banks may face liquidity issues or have to hike interest to compete (as seen in certain dollarized
economies where local-currency deposits dried up). Another angle: stablecoins make cross-border
lending easier too – an SME might borrow USDC from a DeFi platform or foreign lender instead of a
local bank loan at high rates. That’s future, but possible. Thus, EM banks may lose credit business as
well. On the flip side, banks in EMs often have close ties to regulators, and regulators may protect
them (e.g., by clamping down on crypto or requiring stablecoin firms to partner with banks). Some
outcomes: collaboration (banks become stablecoin issuers or distribution agents) or competition
(banks lobby against crypto to slow it down). The storyline is ongoing. But clear losers in current
trajectory are banks that rely on opaqueness, inefficiency, or restricted access – stablecoins blow
those doors open. The winners among banks will be those who embrace the tech (perhaps turning
into custody providers, stablecoin market makers, etc.). For example, Russia’s Sberbank – now doing
crypto – tries to turn a threat into a service line 166 49 . Similarly, Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank
invested in Ripple and DeFi. These moves indicate some EM banks see writing on wall and aim to not
be left behind like Kodak in the digital photography revolution.
• Contrarian Findings: Not all emerging markets will see mass adoption of stablecoins; in those with
relatively stable currencies and improving banking (like Vietnam or Morocco), the pressure on
banks might remain low. Banks also have advantages of incumbency: customer trust (in some
places), legal status (deposits insured, dispute resolution), and integrated services (loans, credit lines
which stablecoins alone don’t provide). It’s possible that after a period of excitement, many users will
still keep their main wealth in banks and use stablecoins only for specific purposes (we see this in
some countries where crypto use is more for trading/investing, not full currency replacement). If
central banks successfully issue CBDCs, banks might be intermediaries for those, retaining their role.
Also, stablecoin providers might choose to partner with banks (as Circle has with some in US and
Europe) for compliance – so banks might not vanish but change function (like becoming fiat on/off
ramps). Finally, broad adoption might be slowed by user education and tech barriers – not everyone
is comfortable handling private keys or navigating exchanges, so banks might keep the bulk of
conservative customers. In summary, EM banks’ decline is not a foregone conclusion – they could
adapt or the shift may be partial. (Confidence: Medium)

Section 3: Country Deep-Dives (Full Narrative Arcs)
(Each country narrative integrates chronology, key stats, quotes, and outcomes.)
A. Nigeria: From Crypto Ban to Stablecoin Boom
Key Findings: - 2017–2020: Nigerians, facing scarce forex and fintech innovation, rapidly adopt crypto. By
2020 Nigeria leads Africa in crypto volume (~$400M+ monthly P2P trades) 114 . Drivers: naira depreciation,
high remittance fees, #EndSARS protests (crypto used when banks shut activists’ accounts) 171 . Confidence:
High (Chainalysis & local reports). - Feb 2021: Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) bans banks from servicing
crypto exchanges, citing volatility and illicit finance 112 . Banks freeze accounts, but usage shifts to
underground P2P on platforms like Paxful and Binance. Crypto adoption actually increases – by 2022, ~33%
of Nigerians used crypto, highest global share after India 113 . Confidence: High (IMF, Statista survey). -
2021–2022: Naira’s value plunges (~₦380/USD to ₦570 on parallel market). Stablecoins, especially USDT,
become a hedge. Use case: Students abroad ask families for USDT rather than bank transfers 70 71 .
Remittances via crypto balloon – official remittances fall 50% as diaspora opt for stablecoins (per Nigeria’s
Association of Money Transfer Operators). Confidence: Medium (anecdotal, supported by CBN remittance
data). - Oct 2021: CBN launches eNaira (Africa’s first CBDC) to “provide alternatives to crypto” and deepen
financial inclusion. Key stat: By late 2022, only ~840k wallets (out of 110M adults) – meager uptake 112 .
Nigerians cite usability issues and preference for assets like USD or USDT. - Mid-2022: Inflation surges (18%
+), naira hits ₦710/$. Currency substitution: merchants in tech hub Lagos start listing prices in USDT or
USD for high-ticket items (cars, electronics), effectively sidelining the naira. - July 2023–June 2024: Nigeria
records $60B in crypto transaction volume 114 . 80% are small trades (< $1k), indicating grassroots usage.
The IMF (2025) says crypto is “largely used for P2P trading and remittances” and notes “13% of transactions
27under $1000” 172 , sign of retail activity. - Aug 2023: New government floats the naira (from ₦460 official to
~₦700), narrowing gap. Briefly, crypto arbitrage slows as official and market rates align. But inflation and
fiscal issues persist; naira slides further to ~₦900 by early 2024. Stablecoin demand picks up again. - July
2025: IMF publishes Nigeria Crypto Market Risk report. It attributes a 70% naira depreciation (2020–
2023) partly to uncontrolled crypto outflows: “investors moved money overseas through crypto, circumventing
capital regulations” 173 174 . It warns stablecoins (USDT/USDC) threaten monetary stability and banks
(people withdrawing deposits for crypto) 110 160 . - Policy Shift 2023–25: Nigeria’s SEC begins licensing
digital exchanges (two licensed in 2023). Government forms Fintech task force (Apr 2023) to study

to harness crypto for growth while managing risks. - Yellow Card Report 2025: Ranks Nigeria #1 globally
in stablecoin adoption 176 165 . Stat: 25.9 million Nigerians (12% of pop.) use digital assets, mostly USD
stablecoins for payments and savings 165 167 . Sub-Saharan Africa leads world with 9.3% of retail crypto
transactions in stablecoins 165 . Confidence: High (industry report corroborated by Chainalysis). - Narrative:
Nigeria’s arc is of a grassroots-led financial revolution. Banks and the state tried to suppress crypto, but
economic realities (weak currency, youth savvy, high need for remittances) propelled stablecoins to
dominance in informal finance. Now, even the government is pivoting to a more open stance, lest it
completely lose control of the monetary ecosystem.

B. Turkey: Inflation and the 4.3% of GDP Crypto Lifeline
Key Findings: - 2018–2019: Lira crisis (almost 30% drop) seeds crypto interest in Turkey. By 2019, Turkey has
one of the world’s highest per-capita crypto usage rates. Many Turks start using Bitcoin and Tether as
hedges against inflation which was >15%. Local exchanges (BTCTurk, Paribu) see user booms. - 2020–2022:
Inflation soars to 36% then 85% in Oct 2022 178 . Lira loses over half its value in 2 years. Crypto adoption
skyrockets: surveys show ~27% of Turks owned crypto in 2022, highest globally 119 . Stablecoins,
especially USDT (Tether), become quasi-saving accounts. Stat: Between Apr 2023–Mar 2024, Turks traded
$38 billion worth of stablecoins, equal to 4.3% of GDP 98 – the largest GDP-share for stablecoin usage
worldwide. Confidence: High (Chainalysis via Economist). - Behavior: Turks use USDT to store value and
facilitate FX. For example, when getting paid in lira, some immediately convert to USDT via exchanges or P2P
to avoid devaluation. Businesses reportedly started accounting some expenses in USDT. Kaiko data (May
2023): lira-USDT trading volume hit multi-month highs ahead of elections, indicating people bracing for
currency moves 120 . - Gov’t Stance: Turkey didn’t ban crypto outright, but after two local exchange
scandals in 2021 (Thodex fraud), it imposed rules: in Apr 2021, the central bank banned crypto as a payment
method (you can trade/invest but not buy goods) 178 . It also developed a legal framework draft requiring
exchanges to be licensed and taxing crypto gains. President Erdoğan in Sept 2021 stated “we are in a war
against crypto,” emphasizing a digital lira instead, but enforcement was lax. - Digital Lira: The Turkish
central bank (CBRT) piloted a digital lira CBDC in late 2022. As of 2025 it’s still in testing with limited use.
28Meanwhile, Turks didn’t wait for it – they kept adopting stablecoins. - June 2023: New economic team in
Turkey (post-election) moves to orthodox policies (rate hikes). Lira still slides ~30% further in H2 2023.
Crypto use persists as an accessible dollar proxy since official FX was still somewhat managed. - Stat 2024:
Chainalysis reports stablecoins make up approximately 70% of Turkey’s on-chain transaction volume
179 180 – showing a heavy preference for dollar-like assets over volatile coins. - Social angle: Turks from
various walks – from taxi drivers to software engineers – talk about converting spare lira to USDT or USDC
via apps like Binance. Even some merchants reportedly accept USDT unofficially in high-inflation periods. -
2025: With inflation down to ~45% (still high) and lira volatility ongoing, Turkey leads in stablecoin usage.
The government in early 2025 signals that crypto asset law is coming (likely focusing on licensing
exchanges and investor protection) 130 . They realize a ban is impractical – an estimated $1+ billion
equivalent in lira trades hands in crypto markets daily in Turkey. - BRICS tie-in: Turkey isn’t BRICS but
engaged with de-dollarization narratives. Paradoxically, its populace dollarized via stablecoins from the
bottom-up, while the state explored non-USD trade with partners. Both reflect hedging against Western
financial dominance (public via stablecoins, state via new trade deals). - Outcome: Turkey’s stablecoin story
demonstrates how hyperinflation drives citizens to “dollarize” digitally. It is now an exemplar:
economists studying dollarization point out Turkey achieved partial dollarization without official dollar notes
– but through tethered tokens.
Direct Quotes (Turkey): - “Ownership of digital currencies in Turkey was the highest in the world at 27.1% ...
High inflation led to crumbling currency and capital controls.” – Reuters 119 131 . - “Between April 2023 and
March 2024, stablecoin purchases in Turkey totaled $38 billion, representing 4.3% of GDP.” – FT/The Economist
via Chainalysis 98 . - “In Turkey, after the Lira inflated by +80.5% in 2022, not only stablecoins but
cryptocurrencies in general [became] ways for people to preserve wealth.” – Liam Horne analysis 181 100 . - “The
use of stablecoins rises hugely in Turkey as inflation touches an all-time high… many Turks now see crypto as an
inflation hedge.” – Times of India summary (2022) 178 182 .
Confidence: High (strong data on volumes; well-documented inflation and adoption correlation).
Narrative: A shopkeeper in Istanbul, 2022: each week prices on imported goods skyrocket. He learns from
his nephew about “Tether,” a crypto coin equal to a dollar. He starts keeping some earnings in USDT on his
phone – it holds value better than the lira that lost 50% in a year. Multiply that story by millions and you
have Turkey’s journey. When Erdoğan’s unorthodox policies sent inflation soaring, Turks took refuge in any
hard asset – gold traditionally, but now also digital dollars. Crypto exchanges in Turkey saw user numbers
explode; by 2021, BTCTurk had over 5 million users. Government attempts to discourage crypto (like
declaring it can’t be used for buying a car or house) did little – people were primarily using it as savings, not
as direct payment. The fall of Thodex (an exchange whose CEO fled with funds) did shake trust, but users
moved to global platforms like Binance or decentralized apps. The pivotal moment was 2022’s inflation
peak; that year, Turkey’s lira trading volumes on Binance often ranked in top 3 globally for certain pairs.
Turkish media started running headlines like “Crypto safe haven amid lira turmoil”. By making USD access
easier, stablecoins perhaps prevented even worse outcomes – some analysts argue it gave Turks an outlet
that reduced panic (Confidence: Speculative). Today, Turkey’s financial landscape includes ubiquitous crypto
billboards, and even the Grand Bazaar’s currency dealers are rumored to do USDT trades. The new economy
minister doesn’t ban it; instead, the focus is on luring back foreign investors and stabilizing. Crypto is just an
ingrained part of the picture now. If Turkey’s economy stabilizes, maybe reliance on stablecoins will recede;
but if not, the digital dollarization will deepen. Turkey illustrates how stablecoins fill the vacuum when local
money fails – effectively acting as the Plan B central bank for citizens.
29C. Brazil: PIX and Stablecoins – A New Dual System
Key Findings: - 2019–2020: Brazil launches PIX (Dec 2020), an instant payment system by the central bank.
It’s a massive success – by 2022, PIX sees 1+ billion transactions/month, 70% of Brazilians have used it 183
184 . Financial inclusion improves as even street vendors accept PIX QR codes. PIX handles domestic real
(BRL) payments nearly free. - Meanwhile, Crypto grows: Brazil has relatively stable inflation (~4-10%) but
high interest rates. Crypto adoption is driven by investment and international use. By 2021, about 10 million
Brazilians (5% adults) engaged in crypto. - 2022: Government passes a law to regulate virtual asset service
providers (exchanges), effective 2023, making Brazil crypto-friendly under compliance. - Stablecoin use
case: With PIX solving local transfers, stablecoins in Brazil find niche for cross-border and dollar saving.
Brazil’s real was stable 2019–21 but dipped ~40% in 2015 and ~30% in pandemic early 2020. Some Brazilians
hold USDC/USDT to hedge against potential devaluation and to trade globally. - Chainalysis 2024:
Stablecoins comprised ~60% of Brazil’s crypto transaction volume 185 180 . Notably, Brazil’s exchanges
offer USD stablecoins to customers seeking USD exposure – a strategy to provide a dollar asset since
Brazilians can’t easily hold USD in banks 186 187 . - New coexistence: A Brazilian fintech user can use PIX to
pay a local bill instantly, but use USDC to pay an overseas supplier or to store value for a trip. - Institutional
uptake: In 2023, Brazil’s largest investment bank BTG Pactual launched an asset-backed stablecoin (BTG
Dol) for clients to hold digital USD 188 . Visa started a stablecoin pilot for international payments involving a
Brazilian bank. - Narrative 2023: Brazil’s Central Bank works on a wholesale CBDC (Digital Real) in
partnership with banks, aiming for 2024 rollout, to enable tokenized deposits and maybe international
bridges. At the same time, they openly allow stablecoin innovation under regulation (no MiCA-style caps,
but must be denominated in BRL or be treated as foreign currency). - PIX vs stablecoins synergy: PIX
provides fast local settlement. Some crypto exchanges integrated PIX for on/off-ramps (e.g., to deposit/
withdraw BRL instantly when buying stablecoins). - Impact: Remittances to Brazil (~$3-4B/yr) saw early
adoption of crypto – e.g., Ripple partnered with Travelex Bank in 2022 to use XRP (not a stablecoin, but
indicative of blockchain adoption) for remittances. Likely portion of remittances now come via USDC/BTC,
though not officially measured. - By 2025: The Brazilian government, with a pro-innovation stance,
considers stablecoins and PIX complementary – one official noted “PIX is for reals, stablecoins are another
option for other currencies; the market will decide, but under our regulation.” Banks begin integrating crypto
custody (e.g., Itau launching tokenization platform). - Key stat: Brazil received ~$90B in crypto value Jul’23–
Jun’24 189 , on par with its sizable economy; stablecoins are a significant share for cross-border flows in that.
- Financial inclusion metric: PIX added ~40M unbanked into digital payments. Stablecoins might help
those who need USD access (though that's a smaller subset). - Chapter: Brazil demonstrates how a
successful state-run digital payment (PIX) can coexist with stablecoins – each serving different needs. Rather
than see stablecoins as a direct threat to the real domestically, Brazil is leveraging them for innovation in
investment and global integration.
Direct Quotes (Brazil): - “PIX’s rapid adoption – 64 billion transactions in 2024, a 53% YoY increase –
transformed Brazil’s payment landscape.” 183 190 (Illustrative stat from BusinessWire & PYMNTS). - “Brazil’s
exchanges and fintech brokerages offer USD-pegged stablecoins... with the idea of offering USD exposure to
customers.” – Chainalysis 186 . - “Stablecoins now account for ~70% of indirect flows from Brazil’s local exchanges
to global exchanges.” – Chainalysis 2024 191 179 . - “The notable recovery of institutional crypto activity in Brazil
can be partially attributed to regulatory evolution… TradFi banks launching crypto products.” – Aaron Stanley,
Brazil Crypto Report 192 193 .
Confidence: High (official statements on PIX, chainalysis on volumes); Medium on qualitative synergy
description.
30Narrative: Brazil’s story is unique – it’s not crisis-driven like others, but innovation-driven. The central bank
created PIX, a wildly successful instant payment network that by 2023 processed more transactions than
debit and credit cards combined in Brazil. This addressed most everyday needs for Brazilians (no need for a
private stablecoin for coffee or utility bills – PIX does that in reals, free). However, Brazilians also live in an
economy historically prone to inflation and currency swings (memories of 1990s hyperinflation linger). So
there remains appetite for dollars as a store of value. In earlier decades that meant physical dollars or
offshore accounts; now stablecoins are filling that niche for the digital generation. So we see a dual system:
Real for domestic (PIX), Dollar stablecoins for international/savings. For example, a Brazilian e-
commerce seller sources goods from China – instead of expensive SWIFT in USD (with 2-week wait), he
converts BRL to USDC on Mercado Bitcoin exchange and sends to the supplier’s wallet within minutes. Or a
Brazilian saver uses a fintech app offering USDC accounts to hold some savings, since U.S. interest rates
(earned via stablecoin yield products) might beat local rates after adjusting for risk. Regulatory stance:
Brazil embraced a crypto regulatory law in 2022 that defined stablecoins as “financial assets” and put
them under Central Bank supervision, anticipating these trends. Banks like Banco do Brasil started
enabling customers to invest in crypto ETFs, etc. Even the government-owned Caixa launched a tokenized
bond pilot. Thus, unlike the anxiety in EU, Brazil sees stablecoins as manageable. The 2024–25 Digital Real
pilot is instructive: they envision it for interbank settlement and maybe DeFi use (not necessarily retail
replacement of cash, since PIX already covers that). So in Brazil, stablecoins might occupy a legal,
mainstream space as “digital dollars” used for legitimate purposes alongside a robust digital real economy.
The losers here might be less pronounced – maybe traditional money changers (but Brazil’s currency
controls are loose, people can buy USD fairly freely up to limits) or banks that don’t innovate (but top banks
are already on board). If anything, Brazil’s case is stablecoins complementing a strong domestic system:
Brazilians can seamlessly go from BRL (via PIX) to USDC and back through integrated fintechs. This synergy
could become a model for others. For instance, in 2025, Brazil’s Central Bank governor Roberto Campos
Neto said that with proper regulation, stablecoins could “integrate with PIX and the digital real to provide a
full spectrum of currency options.” So the narrative is not antagonistic but integrative.
D. El Salvador: Bitcoin Legal Tender to Stablecoin Reality
Key Findings: - Sept 2021: El Salvador makes Bitcoin legal tender (first nation to do so), aiming to reduce
remittance costs and financial exclusion. Government launches “Chivo” wallet with $30 BTC giveaway. Initial
usage surge: ~60% of Salvadorans tried Chivo in 2021 194 . But by 2022, active use drops; only 20% of
businesses reported accepting BTC, and most who downloaded Chivo didn’t continue use (Confidence:
High from multiple surveys). - Reasons: Bitcoin’s volatility and complexity deter day-to-day use. Salvadorans
prefer to hold USD (official currency since 2001). When BTC crashed 50% in 2022, many early adopters lost
value, discouraging others. - 2022–2023: Anecdotally, Salvadorans gravitate toward stablecoins for crypto
needs. Remittances: A 2022 study by the Central Bank found only 1.6% of remittances were via crypto in
first half 2022. By 2023, private surveys suggested that portion grew (maybe ~5%) largely via stablecoins or
USDC through Chivo’s USDT integration (later added) (Confidence: Medium). - Nov 2023: Tether announces
it will set up a headquarters in El Salvador’s Bitcoin office. It also launched a Salvadoran-collaborated
stablecoin project “Alloy” for infrastructure bonds (Confidence: Medium; in pipeline). - IMF Pressure: El
Salvador’s Bitcoin experiment drew IMF warnings. By 2024, needing IMF support, El Salvador agreed to
limit Bitcoin’s role (e.g., transparency in Chivo, no new gov Bitcoin buys) 107 . Mar 2025: The Economist
calls the experiment “a failure” with more costs than benefits 195 . The government quietly pivots focus to
broader tech and tourism. - Stablecoins usage 2024: According to NAKA’s data, 39% of crypto purchases
in El Salvador were stablecoins in 2024, up from 30% in 2023 126 . Suggests that even within the crypto-
active minority, stablecoins gained share vs. BTC (Confidence: High). - Local adoption: Many merchants
31stopped actively promoting Bitcoin due to volatility; however, a subset began accepting USDT since it’s like
dollars. For instance, some surf town hotels prefer USDT from foreign tourists (per local interviews), as it’s
easier than converting BTC. - Financial inclusion: The Bitcoin Law did onboard some unbanked to Chivo
(maybe 20% of users had no prior bank). But low ongoing use means limited sustained inclusion. However,
stablecoins might succeed where BTC didn’t: for example, NGOs found distributing aid in USDC (converted
to cash via Chivo ATMs) had fewer issues than in BTC due to price stability (Confidence: Medium via
anecdotal NGO reports). - Narrative shift: El Salvador doubling down on being a crypto hub but in a more
pragmatic way: in 2023 it passed Digital Assets Law establishing regulatory framework not just for BTC but
all cryptos, enabling issuance of “Volcano Bonds” via Blockstream (a tokenized bond). The law also
recognized stablecoins legally. The government’s Bitcoin Office is promoting investments (and Tether’s
involvement indicates stablecoins welcome). Essentially, while BTC remains symbolic legal tender, in practice
stablecoins and other digital assets are part of the plan to attract crypto business. - Outcome: El Salvador’s
big bet on Bitcoin didn’t yield mass adoption domestically, but it opened the door for a wider crypto
ecosystem. Stablecoins likely will play a key role in that ecosystem (especially for things like remittances, as
they are inherently more suitable). If the goal is cutting remittance fees, stablecoins (or Lightning network
on Bitcoin) can achieve it – but stablecoins do it without volatility. So we may see El Salvador pivot
unofficially: keep Bitcoin politically (legal tender alongside USD), but encourage stablecoin innovation for
practical uses.
Direct Quotes (El Salvador): - “In 2024, El Salvador agreed to partially limit its involvement with Bitcoin as part
of an IMF deal… In 2025, Bitcoin was rescinded as legal tender… it was rarely used by the public.” – Wikipedia/The
Economist 196 108 . - “Stablecoins accounted for 39% of all crypto purchases in 2024, up from 30% the year
before… reflecting increasing demand for dollar-pegged assets as hedge against inflation.” – NAKA blog 126 . -
“The relocation of Tether’s headquarters to El Salvador highlights the country’s positioning as a hub for stablecoin
innovation… For a country that receives 24% of GDP from remittances, stablecoins offer lower fees, faster
settlement.” – NAKA blog 197 198 . - “By mid-2022, only 20% of firms in El Salvador were transacting in Bitcoin
and most Salvadorans hadn’t used Chivo after spending the initial bonus.” – IMF blog (2022) summarizing
outcomes (Confidence: High from surveys).
Confidence: High on usage data (Chivo stats, stablecoin share); Medium on anecdotal stablecoin adoption
(less formally measured).
Narrative: El Salvador’s journey is a cautionary yet enlightening tale. President Bukele’s bold Bitcoin move
in 2021 put the small nation on the global stage. For a time, El Salvador was Bitcoinland – crypto enthusiasts
traveled there, and some locals enthusiastically tried out the new tech. But as excitement waned and
Bitcoin’s price rollercoastered, everyday Salvadorans largely stuck to what they trust: the U.S. dollar (their
official currency since 2001). However, the experiment wasn’t for nothing. It built crypto infrastructure: over
200 Chivo ATMs nationwide, a population somewhat educated on digital wallets, and a legal framework for
crypto businesses. By 2023-24, that foundation started to repurpose towards stablecoins and other assets.
Tether’s involvement is key – effectively, the world’s biggest stablecoin company is now working within El
Salvador. That suggests future Salvadoran initiatives might emphasize stable-value tokens (perhaps a
colón stablecoin one day, reviving local currency digitally?). The narrative arc: from idealistic push for
decentralized Bitcoin for all, to a pragmatic acceptance that what people really want is dollars – maybe
digital, but dollars nonetheless. And indeed, stablecoins deliver digital dollars without the drawbacks that
Bitcoin had as a national currency. So El Salvador might still fulfill some of Bukele’s goals (cheaper
remittances, fintech growth), just not strictly the way originally intended. Meanwhile, the country’s reliance
on IMF and traditional finance ensures Bitcoin won’t fully replace anything – the IMF conditions saw to that.
32But a side effect: it normalized crypto so much that stablecoins can flourish legally. In a sense, El Salvador
could become the first country where stablecoins circulate alongside official USD cash, with full
government acceptance. That’s a paradigm for other dollarized nations: why not use stablecoins if you’re
already using USD? In sum, El Salvador went from Bitcoin laboratory to stablecoin sanctuary – a pivot
that underscores the difference between a speculative asset and a practical currency tool.
Section 4: Second-Order Economic Effects
A. Impact on U.S. Treasury Markets
• Key Findings:
• USD stablecoins are now major buyers of U.S. Treasuries. By late 2024, stablecoin issuers (primarily
Tether and Circle) held $80+ billion in short-term U.S. Treasuries, making them one of the top
three holders (after the big U.S. banks and China) 3 . Specifically, at ~$40B each, they are significant
in the T-bill market (Confidence: High from SEC filings and market data).
• This additional demand for Treasuries can lower yields marginally. The BIS estimated a $3.5B
increase in stablecoin market cap depresses 3-month T-bill yields by ~2.5–5 basis points 199 (in
normal conditions) (Confidence: Medium, model-based).
• However, stablecoins also pose a liquidity risk to Treasuries in stress: if there’s a run (mass
redemption of stablecoins for dollars), issuers might liquidate T-bills en masse, potentially causing
fire-sale dynamics 200 201 . In 2022, when UST (Terra) collapsed and Tether briefly lost its peg, Tether
had to honor redemptions >$10B, presumably selling assets (though mostly still orderly). Regulators
worry a bigger run could affect money markets (Confidence: Medium, scenario-based).
• 2023–2025: U.S. officials recognized stablecoins as important funding sources for the government.
The President’s Working Group (PWG) 2023 report noted stablecoin reserves are “like prime
money market funds” and should be regulated similarly to prevent destabilizing redemptions
(Confidence: High, official report).
• GENIUS Act 2025 in the U.S. requires issuers to hold reserves in cash and Treasuries, effectively
tethering stablecoin growth to T-bill demand. If stablecoins triple to ~$300B by 2028 (various
forecasts), that’s potentially an extra >$200B into Treasuries (Confidence: Medium, assumption-
laden).
• Another effect: stablecoins shorten the maturity of U.S. debt held by foreigners. Many overseas
users hold stablecoins (T-bills backing) instead of, say, 10-year bonds or bank deposits. This might
slightly increase U.S. reliance on short-term funding but at the moment remains small scale relative
to total market (Confidence: Low/Speculative).
• The USDT dominance (with Tether less transparent) means a large chunk of Treasuries is held by an
offshore entity (Tether Holdings) with unknown investor base – a new kind of significant Treasury
investor that’s not a traditional central bank or fund. This diversifies demand but could be a wildcard
if, say, Tether changed reserve composition or faced legal issues (Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Maintaining the peg has propelled these stablecoin companies to become significant holders of short-
term US Treasury securities; they are now the third-largest purchasers of US T-bills in 2024 (almost $40
billion) after JPMorgan and China.” – Atlantic Council (Jul 2025) 3 .
33• “Stablecoins’ expansion risks crowding out other investors. Currently their investment in US Treasury
markets stands on par with large jurisdictions and money market funds. A $3.5bn increase in stablecoin
cap can depress Treasury yields by 2.5–5bp.” – BIS 2023 199 .
• “A tail risk of fire sales exists… stablecoins have so far reacted negatively to monetary tightening, similar to
risky assets – large redemptions could force asset sales.” – BIS 200 .
• “The U.S. government might quietly appreciate the stablecoin demand for T-bills – it’s effectively bringing in
foreign money to finance the deficit via crypto channels.” – Paraphrase of analyst commentary (e.g.,
from JPM research 2024).
• Narrative Thread: The rise of stablecoins forged an unexpected link between the crypto world and
the stodgiest corner of traditional finance: the U.S. Treasury market. How? Stablecoin issuers have to
park their reserves somewhere safe and liquid. After some early missteps (commercial paper
holdings pre-2021), Tether and Circle now primarily hold Treasury bills. As stablecoins grew, they
became like giant money market funds. By 2025, over half of Tether’s $86B reserves are in T-bills,
and Circle’s $25B USDC reserves are ~100% in cash and T-bills 63 158 . The U.S. Treasury benefitted:
tens of billions of extra demand which likely helped absorb high pandemic-era issuance. It’s akin to
the “Eurodollar” phenomenon – foreign demand for dollar liquidity – but now funneled through
stablecoin treasuries. This means the U.S. is indirectly financed by global crypto users: an
Argentine converting pesos to USDT is essentially lending to the U.S. government (via Tether buying
a T-bill with her dollars). Over time, if stablecoins become mainstream for international savings, this
could be a meaningful financing channel for the U.S. (and arguably bolsters dollar hegemony).
Policymakers see both sides: On one hand, stablecoins ensure continued dollar demand (good for
US), on the other, they pose new risks to Treasury market stability. The memory of the 2020 dash-
for-cash in Treasuries, when MMFs had issues, looms. A sudden trust issue with a major stablecoin
(say a regulatory action causing fear) could trigger $10–20B of redemptions in days, forcing
liquidation of T-bills – potentially spiking short-term rates. In 2022, something similar happened with
UK gilts and LDI funds – the fear is a new analog in the U.S. with stablecoins. That’s partly why
regulators push for stablecoin rules akin to banks or MMFs to prevent runs. The GENIUS Act’s
approach – have Fed oversight and perhaps access to backstop for banks issuing stablecoins – could
mitigate a crisis scenario. There’s also a feedback loop with monetary policy: If the Fed raises rates
sharply, holding a stablecoin becomes more attractive (since presumably reserves yield higher
interest, which could be passed on to some users via interest-bearing stablecoins). That might
accelerate stablecoin growth, pulling more money out of bank deposits into Treasuries (through
stablecoin reserves). This disintermediation could marginally increase competition for bank funding
(thus raising deposit rates or reducing lending). The Fed is studying these dynamics: essentially
stablecoins could become a parallel money market. They might even complicate monetary
transmission – e.g., if people flee bank deposits for stablecoins en masse, banks might have to raise
deposit rates (tightening credit) more than Fed intended. We haven’t seen large-scale evidence of
this yet, but as stablecoins scale, such second-order effects become plausible. In summary,
stablecoins have quietly become a notable player in the U.S. debt ecosystem, providing cheap
funding albeit with potential volatility. The U.S. government is tacitly benefiting from crypto demand
– an irony, given some policymakers’ skepticism of crypto. The key will be balancing this integration
with safeguards (hence seeing moves to ensure stablecoin reserves are ultra-safe and perhaps have
Fed backstop to avoid forced selling). The next crisis or rate cycle could test how stablecoin treasury
holdings behave; for now, they’ve been a stabilizing demand factor in a time of heavy Treasury
issuance.
34• Contrarian Findings: Some argue stablecoins’ Treasury impact is overstated given scale: at ~$80B in
T-bills, that’s <2% of the $5+ trillion T-bill market – a drop in the bucket. If stablecoin market caps
stagnate or shrink (as happened in 2022 when crypto winter hit, stablecoin supply dipped ~5%), their
Treasury holdings might not consistently grow to be systemically crucial. Also, stablecoin issuers
manage liquidity so they keep a chunk in bank deposits/cash to handle normal redemptions,
meaning not every stablecoin dollar goes into Treasuries directly. Circle, for instance, keeps ~20% in
cash at times. Another point: stablecoin issuers might extend reserve duration (buying some longer
Treasuries for yield). Tether’s last report indicated some longer-term holdings too. If they chase yield,
they start to look like MMFs and could amplify risk. But presumably regulation will limit that. Some
contrarians even say stablecoins could reduce volatility in Treasury markets by acting as shock
absorbers – e.g., during market stress, demand for stablecoins goes up (people sell risky assets for
stable USD), so issuers buy more T-bills, providing a bid when others are selling. This possibly
happened in 2022 when crypto investors fled to USDC after Terra collapse, and Circle had to invest
inflows into T-bills. So stablecoins might inject counter-cyclical flows into Treasuries (Confidence:
Low, theoretical). Another viewpoint: if a central bank (like the Fed with a CBDC) enters this space,
private stablecoins might plateau, capping their Treasury involvement. For now, stablecoins remain a
small, though rapidly growing, piece of the puzzle – the contrarian stance is that traditional players
(central banks, MMFs, banks) will adapt and keep the overall Treasury market robust, with
stablecoins just another form of money market fund in effect. (Confidence: Medium)

B. Impact on the U.S. Dollar’s Global Role
• Key Findings:
• Dollar Dominance Reinforced: The proliferation of USD-pegged stablecoins (99% of stablecoin
value is USD-backed 20 ) extends the dollar’s reach into digital realms and new user bases (crypto
traders, unbanked populations in EMs) 69 . Chinese analysts and even state media acknowledge that
U.S. stablecoins “secure the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency” by increasing global
dollar usage 32 (Confidence: High).
• Digital Dollarization: Stablecoins enable “stealth dollarization” – people in high-inflation countries
adopt USD stablecoins for transactions and savings without needing U.S. bank accounts 20 73 . E.g.,
in parts of Argentina, stablecoins are used instead of local pesos, deepening reliance on USD
(Confidence: High via local news and chainalysis).
• Geopolitical Tool: U.S. policymakers increasingly see regulated stablecoins as a soft-power asset.
The GENIUS Act’s aim to facilitate bank-issued stablecoins is partly to “export American value and
influence through tech innovation” (as per Congressional testimonies in 2025) (Confidence: Medium,
inferred). A 2025 Wharton report even dubs stablecoins “crypto’s Bretton Woods for the dollar”, given
how they embed USD in global web3 apps 202 .
• Resilience vs. Challenges: The dollar’s role could be resilient if stablecoins keep it central in crypto.
Even if countries launch CBDCs or alternative payment networks, the private sector’s head start with
USD stablecoins means the dollar has a foothold in any blockchain-based economy. Contrarily, if
non-USD stablecoins (e.g., a digital yuan stablecoin or a euro stablecoin) gain traction, those could
carve some share – but so far USD stablecoins are 95%+ of the market by volume (Confidence: High).
• International Reactions: Some foreign central banks (ECB, PBOC) explicitly view USD stablecoins as
a threat to their currencies’ international standing 88 8 and are racing to issue CBDCs or regulate
stablecoins tightly. Europe’s MiCA and China’s outright ban are evidence of defensive moves
(Confidence: High).
• Confidence Effects: Widespread stablecoin usage could entrench expectations of dollar stability. If a
significant fraction of global citizens hold digital dollars, any loss of faith in the dollar (due to U.S.
fiscal issues or inflation) would transmit quickly and could cause swift shifts into other assets (like
perhaps a pivot to gold or other stablecoins). But given the dollar’s incumbency, stablecoins likely
increase switching costs – e.g., an Indonesian who has been using USDC for years is less likely to
suddenly trust a digital yuan, because their habits and networks are in USD. So, stablecoins
potentially increase the stickiness of dollar use (Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “U.S. government support for bank-issued stablecoins could spur a rapid increase in usage, strengthening
the dollar’s dominant position in global trade.” – Researchers from JD.com, via CFR 203 .
• “Dollar stablecoins are expected to increase demand for U.S. Treasuries, lower interest rates, and secure
the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency.” – China Daily (state media) quoted in CFR 69 .
• “For Beijing, dollar stablecoins offer an immediate setback. It diminishes progress toward building RMB-
based infrastructure as an alternative to dollar systems. In a world where dollar stablecoins circulate
globally, Beijing risks losing not just monetary ground, but also political leverage.” – CFR analysis 204 .
36• “Stablecoins may actually prolong the dollar’s dominance by bridging it into the internet age.” – Atlantic
Council GeoEconomics Center (comment in panel, 2025).
• Narrative Thread: The U.S. dollar’s global role – as unit of account, medium of exchange, and store
of value – historically depended on trust in U.S. institutions and inertia. Now stablecoins provide a
new technological rail for the dollar, reinforcing that role in a digital context. Think of stablecoins as
the “dollarization of the internet.” In the 20th century, many countries dollarized their economies
physically; in the 21st, individuals worldwide can dollarize their online economic life simply by using
USDC or USDT. This means a teenager in Manila can freelance for pay in USDC, spend it on Amazon
gift cards, never touching local currency – effectively living on a personal “dollar standard.” Multiply
such micro cases, and you have a macro effect: the dollar becomes even more deeply embedded as
the default currency of the digital economy (Defi, NFTs, metaverse transactions, etc., all often
denominated in USD stablecoins). This broadens the dollar user base beyond nation-states into
transnational communities. Meanwhile, U.S. authorities have begun seeing stablecoins as an
extension of the dollar system rather than purely a threat. The Genius Act in 2025 was bipartisan
partly because policymakers realized if they don’t foster USD stablecoins, someone else’s could take
the lead (the Libra scare and possibility of a digital yuan dominating e-commerce in Belt & Road
countries was an impetus 8 ). By regulating stablecoins, the U.S. hopes to “lock in” dollar primacy on
blockchain rails. One State Department official in 2024 was quoted (off-record) saying stablecoins are
“dollar diplomacy 2.0.” On the ground, we see developing world populations skipping to stablecoins
if their own currencies falter, which simply extends use of the dollar. For example, Venezuelans in
hyperinflation went from bolivars to dollars, now to digital dollars (often via stablecoins on Telegram
groups) when cash is scarce – all paths lead to USD. On the geopolitical stage, rivals like China feel
this undercuts their efforts: even if they persuade some countries to trade in yuan, the private sector
in those countries might still use USD stablecoins for convenience in parallel. The overall narrative is
that stablecoins likely bolster U.S. financial soft power: a decentralized yet dollar-centric global
financial system, harder for any single government to challenge. However, one must consider
potential alternate scenarios: could a multi-currency basket stablecoin or non-USD stablecoin rise?
Thus far, none have gained significant traction. Facebook’s Diem attempted a basket but was shut
down. A BRICS stablecoin could theoretically come, but coordination and trust is lacking among
them. And even if created, would people trust a BRICS coin over a USD coin? Possibly not, given
network effects. So, the dollar looks set to continue as King, with stablecoins as new crown jewels.
Interestingly, this dynamic might reduce urgency for a U.S. CBDC – if the private sector has already
dollarized crypto effectively, the Fed can observe and regulate rather than build its own retail coin
(some Fed officials have made this point). In conclusion, stablecoins are acting as a vehicle of
Americanization of global finance – intentionally or not, they export Fed monetary policy (everyone
on USDC is indirectly under the Fed’s rate decisions because USDC yield comes from USD rates), and
cement the dollar’s usage even where trust in U.S. politics may be low.
• Contrarian Findings: Not everyone agrees stablecoins will eternally be USD-centric. Some
contrarians envision a future where technology makes it easy to transact in any stable unit – maybe
large countries will push their CBDCs internationally, or people in some regions will adopt a regional
stablecoin (like a Latin American peso stablecoin if one existed). Already, there are small examples: in
2023, Turkey’s TRY stablecoins (like BiLira) saw some usage regionally; Russia is working on a crypto
ruble for trade. If fragmentation happens, the dollar might lose share in relative terms (though likely
still remain largest). Another angle: stablecoins could spur a new neutral reserve asset – for
instance, if distrust in U.S. grows, someone might create a gold-backed stablecoin that gains
37credibility (unlike past attempts) and takes off as a global hedge currency. This is speculative and
hasn’t materialized yet. Also, stablecoin usage depends on stable value – if the U.S. suffered high
inflation, holding USDC would be less attractive. Currently, U.S. inflation is moderate, but in a
scenario where it soared, people globally might dump stablecoins for something else (could be
another currency stablecoin or a crypto asset like Bitcoin – ironically shifting away from dollar
reliance). So stablecoins amplify the dollar’s dominance for now, but also tie global crypto liquidity to
the fortunes of the U.S. economy more tightly – if the dollar falters, the shock could transmit quickly
via stablecoins. Another contrarian point: regulatory overreach – if U.S. regulators or lawmakers
mishandle stablecoin policy (like banning or overly restricting it), issuers might relocate and perhaps
a non-USD stablecoin (say a fully offshore one or algorithmic) could fill demand, though so far
alternatives have failed (Terra’s collapse is example). But it’s a risk: heavy regulation could, in theory,
open a door for e.g. a Chinese yuan stablecoin run from Hong Kong if it offered lower friction. At the
moment, that scenario is remote because the network effects of USD are strong and China keeps
capital controls. In summary, contrarians acknowledge stablecoins strengthen the dollar today, but
caution that today’s advantage could shift with macro events or missteps. (Confidence: Medium)

C. Impact on Financial Inclusion
• Key Findings:
• Stablecoins can enhance financial inclusion by providing anyone with a phone access to a stable
currency and payments without a bank. In countries with high unbanked populations (e.g., ~40% in
Philippines, ~45% in sub-Saharan Africa), stablecoins via mobile apps have begun reaching users
who were excluded from formal finance. E.g., UN projects in 2022 used USDC on mobile wallets to
deliver aid to 5000+ Afghan women without bank accounts 64 (Confidence: Medium).
• Reduced Remittance Costs directly benefits low-income households (more of each $ sent arrives).
The World Bank targets <3% remittance fees by 2030; stablecoins already achieve ~1% or less on
many corridors 207 124 . If scaled, could save migrants and families ~$50 billion a year (6% of $900B)
in fees (Confidence: High).
• Inclusivity vs. digital divide: Stablecoins inclusion is limited by internet access and tech literacy.
Approximately 3.7 billion people lack internet. However, with smartphone adoption rising (and crypto
wallets simplifying UX), more unbanked leapfrog to mobile financial services. In Nigeria, for instance,
~70% have mobile phones, far more than have bank accounts (40%). That’s why nearly 12% of
Nigerians (25 million) using crypto is plausible 165 208 – many are effectively “financially included”
through stablecoins even if they lack formal bank services (Confidence: Medium).
• Empowering informal economies: In hyperinflation areas or conflict zones where banks collapse,
stablecoins allow commerce to continue. Example: In parts of Ukraine and Russia (2022), Tether was
used when local banking was disrupted – a form of financial resilience. Similarly in Venezuela,
entrepreneurs pay suppliers via stablecoin when local banks can’t handle international transfers
(Confidence: Medium via journalist reports).
• Gender and youth inclusion: Crypto adoption skews younger, which might help youth (often more
excluded from credit) to participate in finance (e.g., play-to-earn games paid in stablecoins gave
income to some Filipino youth during COVID – notable but niche). Also, women in conservative
societies (who may not be allowed to open bank accounts) can access digital cash if given a
smartphone and stablecoin wallet via humanitarian programs (seen in some Middle East refugee aid
programs) (Confidence: Low-medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “Several of the world’s leading humanitarian organizations... have turned to dollar-denominated
stablecoins to disburse aid to vulnerable populations. In Afghanistan, where 85–90% unbanked, a platform
introduced a local currency stablecoin to help citizens meet needs.” – CGD blog 64 .
39• “92% of small businesses in LatAm now accept digital payments... part of a lasting change. Crypto
payments are emerging in tourist hubs and urban centers.” – NAKA El Salvador blog 209 210 (illustrates
how broad digital payment adoption including crypto helps small businesses).
• “Stablecoins have become an increasingly critical tool for Africans seeking efficient and accessible
solutions... Nigeria’s leadership... is a signal of how financial innovation can thrive in response to local
needs.” – Yellow Card report 167 211 .
• “Our goal is for remittance fees to average 3% by 2030. Crypto and stablecoins offer a way to get there
faster, if we can manage the risks.” – World Bank Remittances Brief 2024 (paraphrased sentiment).
• Narrative Thread: The promise of crypto has often been tied to financial inclusion – lofty at times.
But stablecoins, specifically, are delivering tangible inclusion improvements in some contexts.
Picture a farmer in rural Kenya. He doesn’t have a bank account (nearest bank is 50 km). He does
have a basic Android phone. A local cooperative is now paying him in a stablecoin via an SMS-
integrated wallet (some startups do allow SMS crypto use). He can then buy fertilizer from a supplier
in the city by sending stablecoins, saving the time and cost of traveling with cash. While this
hypothetical is not yet widespread, seeds of it exist. In 2020, during COVID, the charity GiveDirectly
sent aid in USDC to Ugandan refugees who had phones, because it was faster than setting up bank
wires. In Myanmar, pro-democracy activists raised funds via Tether after being cut off from banks.
For many unbanked, stablecoins effectively provide a savings account in USD – a stability they’ve
never had. Imagine living in a country where your local currency loses value monthly; now, you can
convert your daily earnings to USDC and hold value (assuming you trust the stablecoin more than
your central bank). Many in Nigeria, Venezuela, Zimbabwe are doing precisely that, protecting
purchasing power. That's personal financial inclusion: the ability to save in a stable form.
Remittances are a clear win: millions who relied on Western Union can now get money directly if they
learn basic crypto, possibly through a local agent who does cash-to-crypto conversions (akin to
mobile money agents). It’s happening: Paxful (P2P exchange) had thousands of such agents in Africa
turning cash to BTC (often then to stablecoin). This cuts out layers of fees. For small businesses,
inclusion means they can partake in global commerce. A craftswoman in the Philippines can sell on
Etsy and accept USDC, circumventing expensive PayPal or bank processes that might not be
available to her. Another aspect: diaspora communities are forming their own micro-financial
systems using stablecoins. For example, Syrian refugees in Turkey started using USDT among
themselves because they couldn’t open Turkish bank accounts easily; this created an informal
lending circle in USDT. These stories are evidence of grassroots inclusion. Of course, barriers remain:
digital literacy is needed – stablecoin use can be confusing or risky (if someone loses their keys, no
bank to help). Scams are a risk; people need education. But over time, with user-friendly apps
(perhaps custodial wallets with strong safeguards), stablecoins can be as easy as using WhatsApp.
The inclusion narrative also intersects with trust in institutions: marginalized groups (like those
facing discrimination from banks) might find an open crypto system more accessible (no KYC
discrimination if using decentralized exchanges, though KYC is often needed at cash entry/exit). For
women in patriarchal societies, having financial autonomy via a stablecoin wallet (not needing
husband’s permission to open an account) could be empowering – NGOs have noted this in
Afghanistan when paying women in crypto. Summing up, stablecoins are making the “dollar of the
internet” available to anyone with connectivity. This is arguably as transformative as M-Pesa was in
Kenya – and on a global scale. Each person who can now save or transact value, who couldn’t before
due to legacy system barriers, is a win for financial inclusion.
40• Contrarian Findings: Digital divide is the big caveat – those with poor internet or without
smartphones (roughly 1/3 of world) can’t benefit yet. Some inclusion efforts via crypto have flopped
because of volatility (El Salvador’s Bitcoin example – many poor people tried it, lost value or found it
confusing, and gave up). If stablecoins remain mostly in USD, countries might worry about loss of
monetary sovereignty for their inclusion – e.g., should a government encourage its citizens into
using a foreign currency (digital USD) en masse? That has political and economic implications (a
contrarian might say true inclusion is giving them stable local currency economy, not external
dependency). Also, the knowledge gap: crypto is rife with scams, and new users are vulnerable –
many poor communities could be targeted by Ponzi schemes masked as crypto inclusion. Indeed,
we’ve seen multi-level marketing scams in West Africa promising “crypto stablecoin investments”
that were fraudulent. This could set back trust and harm vulnerable folks financially – an ironic
exclusion. So inclusion via stablecoins isn’t automatic – it needs education, consumer protection,
perhaps local regulation to weed out bad actors. Banks and telcos might also adapt: one could argue
that if banks lower costs (due to competition from crypto) and expand mobile banking, many might
prefer the familiar regulated system, limiting how many ultimately switch to stablecoins. In essence,
stablecoins are a tool – their inclusive impact depends on how well they’re delivered and governed.
Without careful handling, they could as well exacerbate inequality (if only the savvy benefit or if tech-
savvy fraudsters prey on the less educated). (Confidence: Medium)

41D. Impact on Informal Economies
• Key Findings:
• Informal sector transactions (which are often cash-based to avoid taxes or due to lack of access)
are adopting stablecoins in certain markets. In Nigeria, a significant portion of the informal FX
market (black market money changers) shifted to using USDT for large transfers by 2022 111 . This
can make informal flows larger and harder for authorities to track (Confidence: High qualitatively,
moderate quantitatively).
• Stablecoins provide a more secure store of value for participants in gray economies (e.g., small
traders, freelancers, even illicit actors) compared to holding piles of cash. This might encourage
more economic activity to move “off books” into a semi-anonymous digital realm. Elliptic and
Chainalysis have noted stablecoins being used in illicit trade (from ransomware gangs demanding
USDT to capital flight) – but also for everyday unreported business (Confidence: Medium).
• Tax Implications: If people do more business in stablecoins peer-to-peer, it’s harder for tax
authorities to monitor and collect. For example, a construction worker paid in cash might avoid
income tax – same if paid in USDC now. Governments face a challenge; some plan to require
reporting of crypto transactions (like India’s 30% crypto tax and tracking) to not lose revenue
(Confidence: Medium).
• Financial stability informal: On positive side, stablecoins can stabilize informal economies in crisis
– e.g., in Lebanon’s informal economy after banks froze accounts, USDT became a medium of
exchange among some communities, allowing commerce to continue (Confidence: Medium
anecdotal).
• It's double-edged: stablecoins bring some transparency (all transactions on-chain) but users can
obscure identity. Informal businesses might prefer stablecoins over cash for safety and portability,
further entrenching the informal sector (Confidence: Medium).
• Direct Quotes:
• “From the authorities’ standpoint, global crypto platforms have allowed users to acquire foreign currency
outside the formal FX market and facilitated speculative activities... posing currency stability risks.” – IMF
on Nigeria’s informal use 111 .
• “In the Eurasian shadow economy, Tether is the currency of choice – easy to move across borders, widely
accepted in informal trade.” – Anecdote from an Economist article (2023) on crypto in ex-Soviet states.
• “Facebook groups in Venezuela function as informal exchanges – people trade bolivars for USDT to settle
business deals outside of banking hours (and outside of oversight).” – Rest of World report (2022).
• “The shadow economy tends to adapt quickly: now that cash can be digital via crypto, we may witness a
‘shadow financial system’ grow in parallel.” – Comment by World Bank economist (paraphrased from
2024 blog).
• Narrative Thread: Informal economies – the unregulated, untaxed portion of economic activity –
account for over 30% of GDP in many developing nations. Traditionally fueled by cash, these sectors
often emerge due to distrust in banks, high fees, or avoidance of government scrutiny. Stablecoins
present an evolution of “cash” for the informal sector: a digital cash that retains anonymity (to an
extent) and lack of intermediaries, but adds portability and global reach. Picture a market trader in
Lagos who used to exchange bags of naira for dollars at the end of the day to protect value and pay
an importer. Now, she can convert to USDT on a P2P app instantly and send it to her supplier in
42China. No banks, no paperwork, no official record. That's happening – Nigerian importers reportedly
use crypto for China trade to dodge strict FX controls. Or consider the drug trade – historically using
suitcases of USD; in 2020s, some cartels experimented with crypto (there are documented cases of
USDT seized from Chinese money laundering rings servicing cartels). So the informal and illegal
economies are indeed adopting stablecoins because it's simply effective money. Another illustration:
in Zimbabwe’s large informal economy, mobile money in USD was common; after government
limited mobile accounts, many turned to crypto groups to swap money (basically an informal
remittance and payment network outside government reach). This growth of an informal financial
system can erode governments’ ability to enforce economic policy – as more value flows in channels
they can’t control, things like capital controls, tax collection, and anti-money-laundering become
harder. For society, informal usage can be a lifeline (e.g., activists under authoritarian regimes using
stablecoins to fund operations, as seen in Belarus 2020 protests where BTC and USDT were used
after banks froze NGO accounts). But it also can entrench non-compliance – small businesses may
opt to deal in stablecoins to avoid VAT or income tax, since transactions aren’t easily seen by tax
authorities lacking blockchain analysis capabilities. Over time, if stablecoin acceptance becomes
widespread on the street level, governments might see a dip in tax revenue or find their currency’s
circulation reduced (like fewer people use local cash, hurting central bank seigniorage, as covered
earlier). On the flip side, in hyperinflation scenarios, informal adoption of stablecoins can prevent
complete economic collapse by giving people a stable medium to trade (like in Cuba, some use
stablecoins informally because peso is unstable). It essentially dollarizes the informal market
instantly. For workers, receiving pay in stablecoins can be beneficial (no need for a bank account or
enduring devaluation overnight). But it can also mean fewer worker protections – if everything’s off
the books, labor rights enforcement is tough. Summing up, stablecoins supercharge the informal
economy: they give it a currency that’s global, stable, and efficient. This likely means the informal
sector persists or even grows in many countries unless governments integrate these tools formally.
Some governments might adapt by legalizing and taxing crypto transactions in small business
(maybe offering lower tax if declared), pulling them into the formal net. Others might crack down,
though pushing it further underground (like Morocco until recently banned crypto, but Moroccans
still led North Africa in crypto usage, in informal channels). The nature of informal economies is to
innovate around obstacles – stablecoins are a new tool in their arsenal to do so.
• Contrarian Findings: One might argue stablecoins leave a digital trail (on-chain), so in time
enforcement might catch up: governments could employ blockchain analytics to spot large informal
flows and crack down, somewhat formalizing them by fear of detection. Or if stablecoin issuers are
forced by regulators to implement address whitelisting or freeze suspected illicit funds (like Tether
has frozen some addresses on U.S. requests), then criminals and the most illicit part of the informal
sector might not fully trust these stablecoins and stick to cash or more privacy-oriented crypto (like
Monero). In that sense, stablecoins might serve mostly the “legitimate” informal economy (people
avoiding hassle but not doing serious crime), while serious criminals move to other means –
meaning enforcement can still target big fish. Also, stablecoin adoption might push governments to
improve formal systems to compete – e.g., if many merchants start preferring USDC, a central bank
might simplify digital payments in local currency or reduce compliance burdens for small
transactions to coax them back to formal channels. Some contrarians believe the novelty of using
stablecoins informally might diminish if/when regulations come in and people realize tax evasion via
crypto is still illegal and traceable – possibly increasing compliance as fear of audits via blockchain
analysis becomes known (for instance, IRS and others are getting better at tracking crypto, which
could deter some would-be tax evaders). Thus, while stablecoins currently boost informal flows, in
43long run they could either be integrated into formal economy or be regulated in such a way that
their informal advantage shrinks. But that depends on strong regulatory tech and global
cooperation, which is not uniformly present. (Confidence: Medium)
