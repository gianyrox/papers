Real Freelancers Using Stablecoins for Payments –
Case Studies
Mika Reyes – Freelance Designer Turned Startup Founder (USA/
Philippines) – Confidence: HIGH
Timeline & Background: Mika Reyes is a freelance UX designer and entrepreneur who grew up in the
Philippines and later studied and worked in the United States 1 . By 2021, she was doing contract projects
for clients overseas. Frustrated with the friction of traditional cross-border payments, Mika tried accepting
stablecoins (specifically USDC on Solana) for her freelance work 2 3 .
Experience with Stablecoin Payments: In an interview on Artemis Analytics (Feb 19, 2025), Mika recounted
the “magical” experience of being paid in USDC instead of via bank or PayPal. One European client sent her
a payment in USDC, which arrived within seconds to her Phantom crypto wallet – a stark contrast to
waiting days for international wire transfers 3 . “In these freelance projects, I got paid in USDC…and was
floored at how quickly it arrived from my client in Europe! It’s a big upgrade from keeping a ledger between my
dad and I,” she said 4 . (Before stablecoins, she and her father literally kept a manual ledger of IOUs when
moving money between the US and the Philippines, due to the hassle of bank transfers 1 4 .) After
seeing USDC’s speed and near-zero fees, Mika started relying on stablecoin payments for her gigs: “The
transfer was instant with virtually no fees! This method quickly became essential for my freelance work.” 5
Benefits Over PayPal/Bank Transfers: Mika emphasizes that digital dollar stablecoins solved many
problems she faced with traditional payments. With stablecoins, there were no surprise conversion fees or
delays. “Freelancers are tired of waiting days for bank processing and dealing with opaque fees,” she explained,
whereas USDC payouts give instant access to earnings with low, transparent costs 6 . Unlike PayPal or
wire transfers that can take 3–5 days and charge 4–6% in hidden forex and service fees, her USDC payments
arrived 24/7 and preserved value 6 7 . This not only saved money but also protected her from the
exchange rate headaches she’d experienced sending money home to the Philippines.
Current Status: Mika was so impressed by stablecoin payments that she co-founded a startup, Parallax, to
help other freelancers and remote workers receive pay in USDC smoothly 8 9 . As of early 2025, Parallax
reported ~93% wallet adoption among users, reflecting freelancers’ eagerness for faster, cheaper payments
10 . Mika’s story shows the real emotional impact of stablecoins: they turned a once-stressful payday into
an instant, borderless transaction. “I was struck by the potential of stablecoins to move money instantly across
borders without high costs or long waits,” she says, noting that what started as a personal solution for her
now benefits a growing global user base 8 .
Key Quote: “I got paid in USDC…and was floored at how quickly it arrived from my client in
Europe! It’s a big upgrade from [the old way]. The transfer was instant with virtually no fees – this
quickly became essential for my freelance work.” 2 3
1Mohamed A. – Upwork Developer (East Africa) – Confidence:
MEDIUM
Timeline & Background: “Mohamed A.” is a pseudonymous example based on a real freelance software
developer from East Africa (featured in a VaultLeap case study, July 21, 2025). For years, he contracted with
global clients via Upwork, but getting paid was a nightmare due to the limited local banking options 11
12 . His earnings were in USD, but he needed local currency, so he juggled multiple services just to convert
his pay.
Old Payment Friction (PayPal/Wise): Mohamed’s original payout routine involved five steps across different
platforms:
1. Upwork → PayPal: Clients’ payments were first routed to PayPal (incurring ~3–5% in fees).
2. PayPal → Wise: He’d then transfer USD from PayPal to Wise to withdraw internationally. Timing was
critical – if a transfer hit on a weekend or month’s end, extra fees or poor rates applied 13 .
3. Wise → Crypto Exchange: Because local banks weren’t reliable for USD, he would send the money
from Wise to Binance, a crypto exchange 14 . However, Wise often flagged or froze transfers
involving crypto, putting his funds at risk 15 16 .
4. Buy USDT via P2P: On Binance, he’d purchase USDT (a dollar stablecoin) through peer-to-peer
traders, hoping for a decent exchange rate 17 .
5. USDT → Cash: Finally, he’d sell the USDT for local currency to actually use the money at home 17 .
Each hop could introduce delays of several days and layered fees eating up 10%+ of his income 16 .
“Transfers could take days…fees added up fast, cutting deep into his earnings,” the case study notes, and any
account along the chain (PayPal, Wise, or Binance) could unexpectedly freeze funds 16 . Mohamed
described this process bluntly: “I used to convert my Upwork earnings through 3 apps just to get USDT. It was
slow and full of fees.” 18 19 His frustration with PayPal’s high fees and Wise’s bureaucracy will resonate with
any freelancer who has watched a chunk of their pay disappear in transfer and conversion costs.
Switch to Stablecoins: In mid-2025, Mohamed discovered a stablecoin payroll service (VaultLeap) that cut
out PayPal and Wise entirely. Now his clients’ USD payments go directly to a USDC account in his name,
and are instantly settled in USDC (USD Coin) on-chain 20 . This means no more waiting for PayPal to
release funds or for Wise’s transfer windows. Once he receives USDC, he can convert it to local currency
when convenient, or even hold it as dollars to protect against local inflation. According to the report, what
used to take 3–7 days now takes seconds 21 22 : “Now I link my VaultLeap USD account [to Upwork] and my
payment lands as USDC instantly,” he says 23 . From there, he only has one step left – swapping USDC to local
cash – instead of five steps.
Benefits Realized: The impact on Mohamed’s life was significant. He went from worrying about “account
holds and frozen wires” 16 to enjoying “a simple, repeatable system that just works.” 24 He cut out multiple
middlemen, saving an estimated 70–90% on fees and avoiding the week-long payment lag he and many
peers had accepted as “normal.” Now, “no hidden fees, no surprise conversions” – he sees exactly how much
he’s getting, and it arrives in minutes, not days 24 . Perhaps most importantly, he gained peace of mind:
“Time – cut days of waiting down to seconds…no blocked accounts…[and] peace of mind,” the case study notes of
his new stablecoin process 24 . This reflects a medium confidence source (the story comes from the
platform’s own blog), but the details and direct quotes align with common experiences reported by many
2freelancers in Africa, Latin America, and beyond who have turned to stablecoins for relief from high
remittance costs.
Key Quote: “I used to convert my Upwork earnings through 3 apps, just to get USDT. It was slow
and full of fees. Now [my client’s payment] lands as USDC instantly…No flags. No friction.” 18 20
