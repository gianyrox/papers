SECTION 1: MONETARY THEORY — COMPETING CURRENCIES AND STABLE VALUE
------------------------------------------------------------
Hayek’s Private Money Vision – A Stablecoin Reality? In 1976, economist Friedrich A. Hayek argued in The
Denationalisation of Money for privately issued currencies competing on quality 1 2 . He believed private
issuers, driven by profit and reputational incentives, would offer more stable money than monopolist
governments prone to “inflation tax” and abuse 3 4 . Hayek envisioned irredeemable but stable
currencies whose purchasing power stayed constant by design 4 . Stablecoins – privately issued digital
tokens typically pegged 1:1 to fiat – partly fulfill this vision. They represent “a possible solution” to volatility
in cryptocurrency by “incorporating monetary rules” and pegging value to reserves 5 6 . In Hayekian
terms, collateralized stablecoins closely mirror the idea of competitive private currency 7 . They
substitute trust in a central issuer with “a competitive process” among issuers and provide fast, low-cost
transfers while mitigating crypto volatility 8 9 . However, they also deviate from Hayek’s ideal: most
stablecoins “remain inflationary” because they mimic fiat money’s value (e.g. the US dollar) 10 . As one
legal analysis notes, stablecoins meet Hayek’s criteria of stability and transparency but are “not anti-
inflationary” since they inherit fiat inflation 11 . Still, scholars like Firat Cengiz conclude that stablecoins
“satisfy some key conditions of the Hayekian model”, especially if regulation makes them robust,
potentially emerging as “superior-quality Hayekian currencies” that pressure governments to improve their
money 11 12 . In short, stablecoins validate Hayek’s theory that private issuers can produce widely
accepted money, albeit by leveraging public currency credibility rather than replacing it. The so what:
Stablecoins realize the decades-old libertarian vision of monetary competition, forcing central banks to
reckon with an alternative issuance model 13 . This lends intellectual legitimacy to stablecoins as more than
tech trivia – they mark a real-world test of private money’s promise and pitfalls.
Neither Fiat nor Crypto – A Hybrid Form of Money: Stablecoins defy easy classification in monetary
theory. They are not central bank money, not traditional bank deposits, and not volatile crypto-assets – they
form a hybrid category. A recent IMF report calls stablecoins “a cryptoasset that aims to maintain a
stable value relative to a specified asset” 14 15 . In practice, they behave like digital warehouse receipts
for fiat currency, yet they circulate on decentralized ledgers. Top economists note this novelty: “Digital
currencies will create not just a novel form of money, but also a new payment infrastructure,” observed former
Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey 16 . In other words, stablecoins represent a new species of
money – combining the trust of fiat (face-value stability) with the freedom of crypto (peer-to-peer
transacting on a ledger). Academic assessments underscore this duality. For example, stablecoins have
been described as “money-like” instruments, essentially “e-money represented on a DLT platform” – in
other words, the dollars are familiar, but the form is entirely new 17 . They inherit credibility from fiat
reserves yet transcend the limits of traditional e-money, being programmable and globally accessible.
Some scholars even label them “Hayekian currencies” in practice: they offer stability and transparency via
technology, but unlike pure crypto, they don’t rely on scarcity or gold – they rely on credibly backed claims
11 . This hybrid nature has policy implications. It means stablecoins challenge existing legal definitions of
money and deposits, and regulators are converging on treating them as a new category: “payment
1instruments” on blockchain 14 17 . So what? Recognizing stablecoins as a novel monetary form reinforces
the thesis that they are a genuine financial innovation. They are not merely another fintech product – they
blur the line between state money and private token, suggesting a third path in monetary evolution. This
bolsters the view of stablecoins as a fundamental upgrade, akin to when paper banknotes first
supplemented coins or when deposit accounts first supplemented cash.
Good Money in Bad Times – Gresham’s Law Reversed: Classical Gresham’s Law says “bad money drives
out good” when both circulate at fixed value, as people hoard the good (more stable) currency. But in the
real world, when legal tender laws don’t force acceptance, we often see the opposite (sometimes called
Thiers’ Law): people flee to good money. Stablecoins are emerging as that “good” money in high-inflation
economies. In countries like Argentina, Venezuela, Nigeria, and Turkey, households increasingly prefer
USD-pegged stablecoins over rapidly depreciating local currency – effectively a digital dollarization 18
19 . For instance, Argentina’s inflation hit ~143% in 2023, and the peso’s value collapsed 20 . Data show
stablecoin usage surged whenever the peso plunged – when ARS fell below $0.002, monthly stablecoin trading
jumped past $10 million 21 . By late 2023, Argentina’s on-chain transaction volume was 61.8% stablecoins,
far above the global average (~45%) 22 . In other words, over half of crypto activity in Argentina now
consists of stable USD tokens, evidence that citizens use them as a safe-value substitute amid currency
crisis. This is a real-world economic lifeline: as Chainalysis notes, Argentinians “look to stablecoins as a
means of mitigating the effects of inflation and currency devaluation,” with many using them for
everyday saving and spending 23 . Similar patterns appear in Venezuela and parts of Africa, where U.S.
dollar stablecoins circulate in parallel to unstable national monies 24 25 . The implication is that
stablecoins serve as “good money” driving out bad in free circulation – a flipside to Gresham’s law that
vindicates monetary competition. From a development perspective, this dynamic can discipline
governments (who risk losing seigniorage and monetary sovereignty if their currency is abandoned) 26
27 . It also links to Hayek’s idea: if people can easily opt out to a better currency, issuers (including
central banks) face pressure to maintain sound money 1 28 . So what? The rise of stablecoins in
unstable economies underscores their role as critical financial infrastructure. They aren’t just trading tools;
they are monetary stabilization tools for millions. This elevates their significance: stablecoins become a
de facto global lender of stability, upgrading financial resilience in places where electronic banking in local
currency failed to preserve value. It’s a profound upgrade – giving anyone with a phone access to a stable
store of value in real time, something unparalleled since perhaps the introduction of the U.S. dollar itself as
an international anchor.
Money at Light Speed – Higher Velocity and Liquidity: By putting fiat currency onto frictionless ledgers,
stablecoins have dramatically increased the velocity of money. Traditional bank money moves slowly – bank
transfers can take days, and cash circulates hand-to-hand relatively infrequently. In contrast, stablecoins
settle in minutes on-chain and can be programmatically traded 24/7. The result is eye-popping turnover
rates. According to a Cato Institute analysis, the annualized trading volume of U.S. dollar stablecoins
reached \$16 trillion on a base of only \$22 billion in supply 29 . That implies extraordinary velocity: “one
stablecoin is turning over at 914x per year” and even smaller ones circulate 70–150x/year 30 . On average,
each dollar of stablecoin was used ~109 times per year – far higher than the single-digit velocity of U.S.
M2 money supply 30 . This “shock and awe” velocity is a product of technology. As the same study notes,
high velocity is “no accident” – stablecoins settle instantly with finality, are available continuously, and are
“programmable – faster, better, cheaper” for moving value 31 32 . In essence, stablecoins create
liquidity without traditional banking leverage: “the technology on its own generates liquidity, without the need
for leverage,” meaning activity can flourish without expanding bank balance sheets 33 . For monetary
theory, this raises fascinating questions. A higher velocity of base money could amplify the effect of each
2dollar on transactions (potentially affecting inflation if not offset). It also means small pools of stablecoin
capital can support enormous transaction volumes, greasing the wheels of crypto markets and possibly,
in the future, mainstream payments. For example, one stablecoin issuer (Circle’s USDC) reported that
businesses from e-commerce marketplaces to digital content platforms have adopted stablecoins for
payments due to their speed and finality 34 . This hints at stablecoins becoming the backbone for high-
frequency, internet-native commerce. So what? The unprecedented velocity facilitated by stablecoins is a
qualitative leap in financial infrastructure. It recalls the jump from mail to email – money moves nearly at
the speed of information. This upgrade can enhance economic efficiency (reducing settlement times from
days to seconds) and even provides a new “monetary policy tool” as some suggest (since velocity-driven
liquidity could supplement traditional money creation) 33 . The stablecoin infrastructure thus unlocks
fluidity in the financial system that electronic banking never achieved, supporting the thesis of a significant
upgrade.
Seigniorage Shift – From Public Purse to Private Profit: When sovereign governments issue money, they
earn seigniorage – the profit from creating money at a cost lower than its value. Traditionally, central banks
capture this (e.g. by issuing banknotes in exchange for interest-bearing bonds). Stablecoins are changing
the game: private issuers like Tether and Circle now reap seigniorage income that used to accrue to
the public sector. How? They take in fiat dollars and invest them (often in U.S. Treasury bills or overnight
loans), but pay no interest to stablecoin holders. With interest rates high, this becomes enormously
lucrative. For example, Tether – issuer of USDT – has disclosed about $86 billion in assets mostly in
Treasuries. In 2023–2024, Tether made headline-grabbing profits: over \$13 billion in 2024 alone, with
profit margins near 99% 35 36 . Its CTO quipped that the firm could “earn \$15B in 2025, outpacing Wall
Street titans” 37 . Circle, issuer of USDC, earned around $1.7B revenue in 2024 38 . In total, one analysis
estimated stablecoin issuers were earning over \$10 billion annually by late 2025 from interest on reserves
39 . This represents a direct transfer of income: as a Project Syndicate commentary pointed out, “the
interest earned on Treasury assets backing stablecoins now flows to private issuers – such as Circle
and Tether – instead of to the public purse.” 40 Governments are taking note. Economists Angus
Armstrong and Dennis Snower warn that widespread stablecoin use could “erode governments’ control
over money and debt” by siphoning off seigniorage and even destabilizing the traditional banking model
41
42 . Not only do governments lose profit, but if deposits shift to stablecoins, banks lose a cheap source
of funding, potentially shrinking credit unless they pay higher rates. On the other hand, stablecoin
proponents argue this pressure is healthy: it forces more efficient allocation of liquidity and could push
central banks to offer better digital cash (like CBDCs) to compete. So what? The seigniorage shift
underscores how structurally significant stablecoins are. They are re-drawing the map of who profits from
money issuance. This isn’t just a tech disruption; it strikes at a core function of the state. The last time
private entities had such power was in the free banking era of the 1800s. The fact that Tether can rival
major banks in profitability by issuing digital dollars is a startling development 35 . It validates the claim
that stablecoins are the biggest financial infrastructure upgrade in decades – they are even altering the
revenue architecture of the monetary system. Importantly, it raises the urgency for sound regulatory
frameworks, since issuers earning seigniorage must be held to high standards (to prevent runs or
mismanagement of reserves). In summary, stablecoins’ ascent is moving “money minting” from public to
private hands on a large scale 40 , confirming their deep impact on the financial landscape.
Network Economics: Metcalfe’s Law and Platform Effects
Network Effects – Towards a Global Money-Internet: The value of any currency or payment network
increases exponentially with the number of users – a classic network effect encapsulated by Metcalfe’s Law
3(value ∝ n²). Money is a social network: “The usefulness of a particular money depends crucially on the number
of others willing to accept it,” as economist William Luther explains 43 . Stablecoins, by combining internet
reach with monetary function, exhibit powerful network dynamics. Each additional exchange, wallet,
merchant, or user that supports a given stablecoin (say USDC or USDT) boosts its utility for all others. This
has led to rapid user-base growth and liquidity pooling. Consider that stablecoins now make up about
13% of the total cryptocurrency market by capitalization, but account for a far larger share of
transactional volume 44 . This indicates heavy usage per user, consistent with strong network value. There
are signs of winner-take-all dynamics: Tether (USDT) has become the dominant stablecoin, with a
market share often above 50% and embedded deeply in global crypto markets. The “singleness of
money” tendency (people converging on one unit for efficiency) is seen in how US dollar-backed stablecoins
vastly overshadow others 45 46 . Indeed, most stablecoins are USD-pegged (over 90% of volume 47 ),
creating a positive feedback loop: the more people worldwide want digital dollars, the more merchants and
platforms accept USD stablecoins, and so on. This network effect extends to settlement networks too – if
many exchanges and businesses support a particular stablecoin, newcomers will choose it for compatibility.
According to the BIS, stablecoins’ “pseudonymous public blockchain” design means they can spread
borderlessly, linking users across countries in a single network 48 . However, network effects also pose
barriers to entry: Hayek himself underestimated that “we are more likely to see convergence on a relatively
reliable common money unit” than dozens of private monies simultaneously 43 . This suggests a stablecoin
(or a few) that achieve critical mass could enjoy a resilient monopoly or oligopoly (much like Visa and
Mastercard in card networks). So what? The network economics of stablecoins reinforce why they
constitute a major infrastructure upgrade. They bootstrap on existing internet networks, potentially scaling
faster than any prior currency (which grew only as fast as population or trade allowed). If stablecoins
become as ubiquitous as email, they could connect billions of people in one monetary web. Importantly, a
strong network lock-in also means regime change: once a stablecoin is entrenched, switching an
economy (or even a user base) to a different platform – say, a domestic CBDC or a new standard – becomes
very hard due to inertia and coordination issues. This underscores how stablecoins could solidify the
dollar’s network effects globally, entrenching dollarization via technology (as noted by one observer,
“stablecoins are strengthening the supremacy of the US dollar” internationally 49 50 ). In summary,
stablecoins’ value grows with their user network, which is rapidly expanding; this self-reinforcing adoption
is exactly what you’d expect from the most significant financial network upgrade in decades.
Stablecoins as Two-Sided Platforms: Much like credit card networks connect merchants and cardholders,
stablecoin ecosystems connect multiple parties: payers and payees, senders and receivers, borrowers and
lenders (in DeFi), developers and users. They exhibit the hallmarks of two-sided platforms. On one side, you
have consumers (retail users, investors, remittance senders) who demand a stable digital dollar; on the
other side, businesses and financial institutions that accept or integrate stablecoins to reach those users
(exchanges, merchants, payment processors, even banks). The more users hold and want to spend
stablecoins, the more merchants will find it attractive to accept them – and vice versa. This creates a
virtuous cycle of adoption. For instance, PayPal’s launch of a USD stablecoin (PYUSD) is explicitly aimed at
leveraging its two-sided network of 400+ million users and millions of merchants 51 . By introducing a
stablecoin into that platform, PayPal can reduce frictions between buyers and sellers (especially
internationally) and keep transactions inside its own ecosystem. Similarly, Visa and Mastercard have been
piloting stablecoin settlement for cross-border payments, effectively using stablecoins as a bridge
between bank networks 52 53 . This indicates that stablecoins are being embedded as a platform layer in
existing two-sided networks. Moreover, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms treat stablecoins as a
foundational layer connecting lenders and borrowers globally – e.g. someone in Country A can lend USDC
to a borrower in Country B via a lending pool, without traditional intermediaries. That’s a two-sided market
4(savers and borrowers) now directly linked by stablecoin protocols. Platform economics theory tells us
that lowering switching costs and increasing interoperability boosts platform adoption. Stablecoins excel
here: any internet-connected device can become a “wallet” accepting a stablecoin, and open standards
(Ethereum ERC-20, etc.) mean any app can plug into the stablecoin network easily. So what? Viewing
stablecoins through the platform lens highlights why they’re transformative. They aren’t just passively
circulating tokens; they form interactive networks that grow more valuable as they scale. This explains
observations like stablecoins reaching $23 trillion in transaction volume in 2024 (90% growth) with flows
spanning every continent 54 55 . They provide a unified medium that “both ends” of a transaction want to
use. As a result, stablecoins can achieve faster adoption curves than earlier payment innovations. (For
context, it took credit cards decades to build a global two-sided network; stablecoins have done so in a few
years by piggybacking on the internet.) This platform dynamic is a key reason stablecoins qualify as an
infrastructure upgrade: they reshape market structure, introducing new intermediaries (or disintermediating
entirely) and connecting participants in ways previously not possible or cost-effective.
Tipping Points and Critical Mass: History shows that new financial technologies often reach a tipping
point where adoption accelerates non-linearly – think of how quickly paper money replaced coins in some
eras, or how mobile payments suddenly took off in certain countries once a threshold of users was reached.
Stablecoins appear to be nearing such thresholds in various domains. One evident case is crypto trading
and settlement, where stablecoins long ago hit critical mass: virtually every major crypto exchange and
protocol supports USDT or USDC, creating a default stablecoin standard. Now we see early signs of tipping
points in remittances and cross-border business. For example, Latin America’s stablecoin-based
remittances have grown sharply – multiple countries in the region rank in the top 20 for crypto adoption
thanks largely to stablecoin usage for sending money home 56 57 . As stablecoin liquidity and cash-out
options improve in those corridors, more people jump on board. There’s also a threshold dynamic with
institutional adoption: surveys indicate that over half of consumers would trust stablecoins more if issued or
custodied by banks, and indeed some banks are exploring their own stablecoins or tokenized deposits 58 .
Should a few large banks or fintech platforms successfully roll out stablecoin services, it could quickly force
others to follow to avoid losing customers (a competitive tipping point). Another aspect is merchant
acceptance. If, say, a critical mass of e-commerce sites or payment processors start offering stablecoin
payment options (as Stripe, Shopify plugins, and others have begun to), consumers will be more inclined to
hold stablecoins for spending – and once a certain percentage of commerce accepts them, paying with
stablecoins could become as normal as using PayPal. This threshold might be, hypothetically, 15-20% of
merchants or users; beyond that, network effects and word-of-mouth drive the rest. It’s noteworthy that
stablecoin transaction volumes are already rivaling traditional networks – by late 2025, monthly
stablecoin payments hit about \$1.4 trillion, roughly matching Visa plus Mastercard volume 59 . Reaching
parity with legacy giants suggests a tipping point: stablecoins are moving from peripheral to mainstream
infrastructure. So what? The existence of these thresholds means stablecoins could very rapidly go from
niche to ubiquitous once certain adoption milestones are passed. We may be on the cusp of such a phase
(“the stablecoin moment”). For policymakers and businesses, this underscores the urgency: if stablecoins
indeed represent the next big monetary network, missing the wave could mean being locked out later due
to switching costs.
Switching Costs and Lock-In: Once people and businesses integrate a particular financial network,
switching to an alternative can be costly or inconvenient – creating lock-in effects. With stablecoins, this is
a double-edged sword. On one hand, if a user base becomes accustomed to, say, using USDC for commerce
and savings, they may be reluctant to switch to a new CBDC or a local digital currency that doesn’t offer the
same interoperability or global acceptance. As one analysis put it, “once such systems are established, network
5effects make switching difficult” 60 . We’re already seeing a form of lock-in in crypto markets: many
decentralized apps quote prices in USD stablecoins; if an app tried to use a different unit, users would likely
not bother switching en masse. In the future, imagine a country where a large fraction of commerce is
conducted in USD stablecoins. If that country introduces a domestic CBDC, merchants and consumers
might resist adoption – why switch from a widely accepted, familiar stablecoin to a new currency that few
external partners use? This could undermine local monetary initiatives (a scenario worrying some central
bankers 26 27 ). Another example: corporate treasuries and investors are beginning to hold stablecoins for
liquidity. If their systems and counterparties are set up for USDC, moving to anything else involves
retraining staff, changing software, and accepting potential value fluctuations – significant friction. This
resembles the lock-in credit card networks have with merchants (once you accept Visa, you might hesitate
to invest in another system that few customers use). The result is path dependence: early stablecoin
movers gain an entrenched position. Indeed, regulators have noted that private stablecoins, if widely
adopted, could create “new forms of too-big-to-fail” infrastructure that the economy becomes
dependent on 42 . So what? Lock-in means stablecoins are not a transient crypto trend; they could become
embedded in the plumbing of finance. Every additional integration (a wallet, a point-of-sale system, an ATM
network supporting stablecoins) increases the cost of uprooting them. This strengthens the thesis that
stablecoins are the most significant upgrade since electronic banking – because like the shift to electronic
payments, once we all moved online we never went back to paper, and once networks like SWIFT or Visa
were in place, they became hard to displace. We may be witnessing stablecoins achieving a similar
irreversibility. It also highlights that whoever sets the stablecoin standards now (whether private firms or via
smart regulation) could define the architecture of money for decades. That is precisely why we see
geopolitical jostling – for example, U.S. policymakers realizing that “stablecoins can reinforce dollar
supremacy” if the U.S. leads, while rivals fear being left out 49 61 . In summary, stablecoins’ growing lock-in
effects solidify their role as core financial infrastructure, making the current moment pivotal.
Infrastructure and Ledger Innovation: The Ledger is the Revolution
The Ledger, Not the Token, is the Innovation: Many economists and technologists argue that the true
breakthrough of stablecoins lies in how value moves, not what the value is. The key innovation is the
open, distributed ledger that records ownership and transfers of money. In other words, the rail itself
is revolutionary, even though the “train” (the dollar) is familiar. MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative often
emphasizes that cryptocurrencies have introduced a new ledger technology – one that is global, near-
instant, and operates without centralized clearing 62 63 . Stablecoins harness this for fiat money. As
Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire puts it, stablecoins “standardize the transport” of dollars without changing the
dollars 64 . An American Institute for Economic Research piece made this vivid with an analogy: “What the
shipping container did for physical goods, stablecoins now promise to do for money.” 65 Just as the
container in the 1950s created a standard size and system that revolutionized global trade (making it
frictionless to move goods between trucks, ships, and trains), stablecoins create a standardized digital
container for value, allowing money to move across platforms and borders with minimal friction. This is why
despite being “pegged” to old units, stablecoins feel like a new paradigm. They run on internet protocols
instead of proprietary bank networks. They settle peer-to-peer with finality, rather than through multi-day
interbank processes. Crucially, they are interoperable: any developer can integrate a stablecoin like USDC
into an app with a few lines of code – a stark contrast to trying to integrate, say, ACH or SWIFT, which
require bank partnerships and legal contracts. Prominent policy thinkers have explicitly highlighted this
ledger vs money distinction. Bank of England officials noted that digital currencies create “a new payment
infrastructure” alongside whatever novel form of money they represent 16 . Some economists liken
stablecoins to “Internet of Money” protocols, where the focus is on the network standard (like HTTP for
6data) more than the content itself. In practical terms, stablecoins provide a unified ledger where previously
we had fragmented ones. Today’s financial system is a patchwork of ledgers – each bank has its own,
central banks have theirs, payment processors maintain separate databases and messaging systems. By
contrast, if a payment flows via a stablecoin on Ethereum, sender and receiver simply update the same
global ledger (the blockchain) with no need for reconciliations between institutions. It’s a conceptual leap
akin to the move from fax machines (point-to-point, incompatible systems) to the internet (one network of
networks). So what? By reframing stablecoins as infrastructure, we see why they are a profound upgrade.
They promise a world where value can be exchanged as seamlessly as information, unhampered by the
siloed nature of legacy banking systems. Historical parallels underscore the significance: The invention of
double-entry bookkeeping in the 15th century gave businesses a reliable ledger to track credits and
debits, laying the groundwork for modern finance. The SWIFT network in 1973 standardized interbank
messages worldwide, massively speeding up international transfers 66 . Stablecoins stand in that lineage:
they introduce an even more radical ledger – unified, programmable, and public (or semi-public). An IMF
blog described tokenized money as part of a “next-generation monetary system” where “tokenized central
bank reserves, commercial bank money, and government bonds” might all reside on a shared ledger for
efficiency 67 68 . While that vision includes CBDCs, stablecoins have been the pioneer in this space, forcing
the conversation. In sum, stablecoins demonstrate that the medium is as important as the message: the dollar
on a blockchain is not the same as a dollar in a bank database. The former can achieve things (instant
global micropayments, atomic cross-border swaps, open-access financial apps) that the latter cannot. That
is why stablecoins can be credibly called the most significant infrastructure upgrade since electronic
banking – they reinvent the ledger upon which all banking runs.
Historical Parallels – From Telegraphs to Containers: To appreciate the stablecoin leap, it helps to
compare it with prior infrastructure breakthroughs. One parallel often drawn is the telegraph and
telephone for money. In the 19th century, the telegraph enabled the first electronic fund transfers (think
wire transfers via Morse code) – drastically reducing the time to send money across distances from weeks to
minutes. Stablecoins similarly compress settlement times for modern transfers (e.g. an on-chain payment
clears in seconds, 24/7, vs a wire that might take a day and only during banking hours). The SWIFT
network, introduced in the 1970s, is another precursor: it set a common standard for cross-border
payment messages, which is one reason global banking became scalable and relatively secure 66 . But
SWIFT still just sends messages – the actual movement of funds still hops through correspondent banks.
Stablecoins cut out those hops by moving the actual value on a single ledger. If SWIFT was a big step
(electronic messaging instead of mailed instructions), stablecoins are perhaps bigger: electronic value
transfer instead of just messaging. The most vivid analogy, as mentioned, is containerization. Before
containers, shipping was labor-intensive and slow; after, global trade exploded 250x over decades 69 70 .
The AIER article notes global trade rose from \$100 billion in 1960 to over \$25 trillion today largely thanks
to container standardization 69 70 . The authors argue stablecoins could do the same for financial exchange,
by standardizing how money moves 71 . By defining basic rules and formats (tech standards, reserve
standards, disclosure) – analogous to defining container dimensions – governments can make stablecoins
safe, interoperable, and scalable 72 . With those standards (e.g. the proposed U.S. “GENIUS Act” and
similar bills 72 ), stablecoins could become a ubiquitous money-transfer standard globally. Already, in 2024
stablecoins processed over \$27 trillion in transactions, more than Visa and Mastercard combined 47 .
They achieved this with a fragmented regulatory environment; one can only imagine the volumes if a
standardized legal framework existed across countries. Finally, consider the distinction between money vs
payment rails some economists make. Central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) focus on the money issued
by government, but even CBDC advocates often acknowledge the private sector might innovate better on
payment rails. Stablecoins essentially are new payment rails carrying existing money. We see this in how over
790% of stablecoin volume is in USD 73 – the unit of account hasn’t changed, but the rail (blockchain) has.
This separation of currency and infrastructure is a key conceptual shift. It means a country could maintain
its fiat currency, yet use a stablecoin network (even a privately run one) as the primary rail – a scenario that
would have sounded far-fetched before stablecoins demonstrated it. So what? These parallels drive home
the point: stablecoins belong in the same conversation as the telegraph, SWIFT, and even double-entry
bookkeeping in terms of impact. They are compressing time and space in finance (telegraph analogy),
creating uniform standards (container analogy), and enabling new levels of transparency/auditability (every
transaction on a public ledger, akin to double-entry’s audit trail). For the thesis at hand, this solidifies
stablecoins’ claim – they are not just incremental improvements; they are a leap to a new paradigm of how
value is recorded and moved. Much like no one would downplay the container’s impact on trade, we should
not downplay stablecoins’ impact on finance infrastructure. If money is the lifeblood of economies, then
stablecoins are like a new circulatory system – faster heartbeat, broader reach.
Money Rails vs. Money Itself – An Economic Perspective: Economists are increasingly distinguishing
between the instrument of money and the infrastructure that transmits it. Nobel laureate Friedrich
Hayek, for instance, believed competition could occur in either the currency or how it’s managed. With
stablecoins, the competition so far is more in the management and delivery than in creating new units of
account. A Bank for International Settlements report in 2025 critiqued stablecoins, noting they “exhibit some
attributes of money” but fail certain tests as the core of the monetary system (due to issues like lack of
lender-of-last-resort) 74 45 . However, that same report acknowledged stablecoins’ popularity as a “gateway
to the crypto ecosystem” and their use in emerging markets for payments 75 76 . The takeaway is that even
if stablecoins don’t replace sovereign money, they may replace or upgrade the payment rails on which
sovereign money travels. Some central bankers have floated the idea of integrating stablecoins with
central bank money – for example, allowing stablecoin issuers access to central bank reserves to back
their coins 77 78 . This implies a possible future where the state provides the money (ensuring stability),
while private innovators provide the rails (ensuring efficiency and user-friendly features). Stablecoins are
the proof-of-concept for this model. They demonstrate that privately run ledgers can handle massive
volumes (trillions per quarter) and innovate rapidly (adding features like smart contracts, microtransactions,
etc.), far beyond what legacy electronic banking offers. So what? Recognizing stablecoins as primarily an
infrastructure innovation clarifies why they are a big deal. It shifts debates from “are these new monies?” to
“how can these new rails improve finance?” The latter is where their transformative potential lies. If one
concludes that stablecoins are essentially financial infrastructure, then it follows they represent the most
significant upgrade since the advent of electronic banking (which itself was an infrastructure leap – moving
from branch-ledger banking to mainframes and online transfers). In the late 20th century, electronic
banking digitized existing processes; stablecoins take the next step by decentralizing and unifying them on
internet protocols. That’s an upgrade not just in degree (speed, cost) but in kind (architecture). It paves the
way for a more integrated global economy – much as container shipping did for trade – by reducing the
frictions and delays in the flow of money. And it addresses long-standing pain points: high remittance fees,
slow cross-border settlements, unbanked populations (more on that in the next section), and siloed
financial apps that can’t talk to each other. All of that can be alleviated by a common, neutral money
infrastructure that stablecoins hint at. In conclusion, the infrastructure viewpoint cements stablecoins’ place
as a historic innovation – the “shipping containers” of digital finance 79 , carrying economic value
seamlessly and setting new standards for a truly open financial system.
8Identity and Privacy Theory: Trust, Anonymity, and “Compliance
without Surveillance”
Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Meets Stablecoins: In a world of stablecoins, identity verification and privacy
become central. Self-sovereign identity is the concept that individuals should own and control their digital
identity credentials, sharing them only when necessary. How does this relate to stablecoins? Imagine a
global stablecoin network where users can transact freely if they can prove certain attributes (not on a per-
transaction basis to a bank, but perhaps via credentials stored in their wallet). For instance, a user might
carry a verifiable credential proving they passed a one-time KYC check by a trusted authority, without that
authority tracking all their transactions. Such a model is being actively explored. The IMF’s research
highlights a “zkKYC” concept – KYC without revealing your customer data – leveraging SSI and zero-
knowledge proofs 80 . In a compliance-by-design stablecoin system, before Alice can send funds to Bob,
both undergo identity verification by a licensed credential issuer, which then stamps a hashed
certificate on the ledger 81 82 . Their wallets can then generate zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to show
they are KYC’d without disclosing who they are 83 84 . Practically, this might mean Alice’s wallet proves “I
am not a sanctioned person and I have a valid ID hash on file” to the network every time she transacts, but
it never broadcasts her name or ID number. This aligns with SSI principles: the user holds credentials and
proves compliance “without exposing them” 85 84 . The benefit is privacy for honest users and data
minimization, while still enforcing that all participants are verified. If something nefarious occurs, an
authority (given legal approval) could decrypt or demand the revealing of the identity behind a suspicious
address, but routine transactions remain pseudonymous. This is a stark contrast to the status quo in
banking, where your bank knows your full identity and can monitor all your spending, and governments can
relatively easily obtain that data via subpoenas or data-sharing. SSI with stablecoins flips the model: you
prove you’re allowed to transact, but no central intermediary sees all the details. This is often referred to as
“compliance without surveillance.” A World Economic Forum report (2026) noted that zero-knowledge
identity frameworks could let stablecoins expand access without compromising privacy or AML controls 80 .
It’s not just theoretical: projects and protocols (like zkSNARK-based identity proofs, or the EU’s explorations
of digital identity wallets) are actively testing this approach. So what? The intersection of SSI and
stablecoins is crucial for the legitimacy of this new infrastructure. If stablecoins are to become as
widespread as electronic banking, they must solve the identity puzzle in a way that balances law
enforcement and individual rights. Achieving SSI-driven compliance would mean stablecoins improve on
traditional banking by giving people more control over their identity data. That’s a societal upgrade. It
positions stablecoins as part of a broader movement to empower individuals (you hold your money and
your ID in your wallet, under your control). It also would address regulators’ biggest hesitation about
stablecoins – that they facilitate illicit flows – by baking in strong identity checks, but in a privacy-
preserving way. In summary, SSI could allow stablecoins to deliver on the promise of financial inclusion
and privacy, something electronic banking has often struggled with (banks tend to either exclude the
undocumented/unbanked or surveil the banked). That makes stablecoins’ infrastructure qualitatively better,
not just faster.
Financial Privacy as a Right – The Stablecoin Dilemma: Is financial privacy a human right? Privacy itself is
recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and many constitutions. Some advocates argue
this inherently covers financial transactions – that individuals have a right to spend or save without constant
surveillance, barring suspicion of wrongdoing 86 87 . For example, the advocacy group Financial
Transparency Coalition noted that while “financial privacy” isn’t explicitly enumerated, “privacy is [a human
right], and it’s reasonable to include financial activities under that umbrella.” 86 87 . This perspective is gaining
traction as digital payments expand. In the cash era, privacy was the default – handing someone paper
9money is an anonymous transaction. But as society moves to digital, that privacy is eroding: bank digital
payments are tracked by banks and often shared with governments; Big Tech payment apps gather data for
profit; and proposed CBDCs raise fears of state surveillance of every transaction. Stablecoins enter this
debate in an interesting position. By design, public stablecoin ledgers (like those on Ethereum, Tron, etc.)
are transparent – all transactions are visible pseudonymously. This means stablecoins are more transparent
than bank accounts (which are private to the parties and the bank) but more private in the sense that no
personal name is attached on-chain by default. Chain analysis firms can often de-anonymize addresses
through metadata or cluster analysis, but it’s not as straightforward as a bank handing over named account
statements. There’s an argument that stablecoins, used peer-to-peer, “reduce direct surveillance” by
cutting out the bank middleman that would normally KYC and flag transactions. A U.S. Congressman, Tom
Emmer, even suggested that private stablecoins could preserve privacy better than a Fed-issued digital
dollar, which might log all transactions centrally 88 . On the other hand, regulators worry that stablecoins’
pseudonymity facilitates crime (as the BIS said: stablecoins have been “the go-to choice for illicit use to bypass
safeguards” precisely because users’ identities are only behind blockchain addresses) 45 48 . They note that
“the pseudonymity…can preserve privacy but also facilitates illegal use,” absent KYC and transaction
monitoring 45 46 . Both things are true – the same feature (pseudonymous ledgers) provides some privacy
for law-abiding users and some cover for bad actors. The policy question is how to tilt this balance.
Technologically, as discussed above, zero-knowledge proofs and credentials could allow “privacy unless
suspicion is detected” 89 . For instance, the IMF model describes encrypted identity tokens on-chain and
smart contracts that only trigger alerts if certain risk indicators appear (large transfers, blacklisted addresses,
etc.) 89 90 . In that scenario, compliant users enjoy full privacy (their personal data never leaves their
device), while law enforcement still gets automated Suspicious Activity Reports for truly suspicious
patterns 89 90 . It’s essentially mimicking the current AML system but without mass surveillance of
everyone – a precision-guided approach rather than dragnet. From a legal scholarship view, this aligns with
the principle of data minimization in privacy law and the idea that surveillance should be targeted, not
ubiquitous. If stablecoin frameworks can achieve this, it flips the narrative: stablecoins could become more
respectful of privacy rights than traditional e-banking, where banks routinely surveil accounts to meet
compliance. For example, an American Banker op-ed insisted “stablecoins need privacy baked in, not
bolted on”, warning that if the industry doesn’t build private-by-design payments, we risk a future of
intrusive financial monitoring by default 91 92 . So what? Privacy is not just a “nice-to-have” – it’s
increasingly viewed as a core feature of next-gen financial infrastructure. Stablecoins are at a crossroads:
they could either entrench a new form of transparency (where every transaction is traceable on a public
ledger), or they could pioneer novel privacy solutions that outperform legacy systems. If the latter path is
taken, stablecoins would indeed represent a major societal upgrade, reconciling digital convenience with
rights protection. They could allow individuals to transact with the anonymity of cash but the convenience
of digital – a combination electronic banking never delivered (electronic banking prioritizes traceability and
centralized control). This reinforces the thesis: stablecoins aren’t just faster wires; they have the potential to
redefine the social contract around money by embedding privacy and individual control in the
infrastructure. Few things could be more significant in a world of increasing surveillance concerns.
Surveillance Trade-offs – Banks vs Blockchains: It’s instructive to compare how much information
different systems reveal. In the bank-centric model, your privacy from the outside world is high (no one can
see your bank transactions except you and the bank), but your privacy from the bank and government is
low (the bank knows your identity and can monitor and must report certain transactions). In a pure-cash
model, your privacy is high in both senses (nobody knows unless you tell them). In a public blockchain
stablecoin model, your privacy from government depends on how well you obfuscate your on-chain identity
(through self-custody, avoiding linking to exchanges, etc.), and your privacy from the public is moderate –
10strangers can see amounts and addresses, but not names. This has given rise to scenarios both good and
bad. On the bad side, we have seen hackers and sanctions evaders attempt to use stablecoins; although,
interestingly, stablecoin issuers and analytics firms have developed the capacity to freeze addresses and
track illicit funds when required (e.g. Tether and Circle have blacklisted scam-related addresses upon law
enforcement request). On the good side, activists and ordinary citizens in repressive regimes have used
stablecoins to escape financial repression. For instance, in Belarus and Nigeria during protests or
crackdowns, people reportedly shifted to crypto dollars when banks were compromised or could surveil and
shut accounts for dissidents. There’s also the case of Ukraine in 2022: when the war broke out, charities
raised millions in crypto (including USDT/USDC) to support Ukrainians, doing so faster than traditional
aid could flow. Those donors valued that they could contribute without going through banks (which might
be slow or block transfers to certain groups) – an example of financial freedoms enabled by stablecoin
networks. However, the transparency meant all those donations were visible on-chain (there are dashboards
showing in real-time how much crypto has gone to Ukraine addresses). This is a double-edged sword:
transparency builds public trust (one can audit how funds move) 93 , yet it also “risks exposure” of
individuals and organizations (which can be dangerous in conflict zones) 93 . The key point: stablecoins
amplify some forms of transparency while reducing others. They reduce reliance on institutional
surveillance (you don’t need a bank watching over your shoulder to transact), but they introduce public
transparency unless additional privacy layers are used. Looking ahead, if no privacy enhancements are
made, we might see a world where every retail transaction (your coffee, your groceries) on a stablecoin is
theoretically visible to any analyst – a scary thought for personal privacy. Conversely, if privacy tech is
integrated, we might have the most open yet privacy-protecting payment system ever: regulators see proof of
compliance, the public sees aggregated data maybe, but personal spending stays personal. This is why
central banks like the ECB talk about “cash-like privacy” for digital currency – trying to replicate the
anonymity of cash to some degree. Stablecoins are spurring this conversation in a way that electronic
banking never did (because stablecoins prove it’s technologically feasible to have pseudonymous digital
cash). So what? The treatment of privacy and surveillance in stablecoin design will greatly influence their
societal acceptance. If stablecoins manage to “get it right,” they could be the answer to a very modern
riddle: how to have a fast, digital economy without giving up all privacy. This would make stablecoins not
just an upgrade in speed or cost, but an upgrade in the quality of financial freedom available to people.
That certainly underpins the thesis of a major infrastructure improvement. Conversely, if they become
hyper-transparent, they might still be an upgrade in efficiency but at a cost to privacy – something
policymakers and users will have to weigh. Either way, the fact that stablecoins force us to grapple with
these fundamental issues (privacy vs security, anonymity vs compliance) shows how deeply they are
changing the financial landscape.
Zero-Knowledge Proofs and “Compliance Without Surveillance”: A centerpiece of the emerging privacy-
compliance solution are zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). These cryptographic tools let someone prove a
statement is true without revealing the underlying information. In the stablecoin context, as detailed by
researchers Pauwels (2021) and highlighted by the IMF 94 95 , this could mean proving “I am over 18 and
not on a sanctions list” without revealing my name or age. Already, protocols like zkSync or Aztec have
demonstrated basic private transactions using ZKPs on Ethereum, and projects are working on zk-proof
based digital ID. The IMF’s model specifically describes embedding a “zkKYC token” into each transaction,
which “proves KYC compliance without revealing user identities”, and notes that the actual identity
credentials remain off-chain in the user’s wallet or with the credential issuer 96 97 . Only if a suspicious
pattern triggers an alert would authorities follow legal process to decode the identity 89 98 . This approach
has been called “privacy-preserving regulation” or “trustless compliance.” It turns the current paradigm on its
head: rather than trusting a bank to surveil and report, the system itself enforces rules with code, while
11keeping user data encrypted. It’s akin to having automated border control gates – your passport is verified by
a machine which only outputs pass/fail, rather than handing your full identity to a human inspector every
time. The IMF authors (which include notable Stanford professor Darrell Duffie) stress that this would
“replace time-consuming off-chain manual reviews with proactive on-chain algorithmic
supervision.” 99 96 In other words, compliance would be baked into transactions via smart contracts.
This yields real-time oversight – a flagged transaction can be halted or investigated immediately, instead of
after-the-fact. Importantly, compliant users’ privacy is largely preserved; the system only unveils data if
red flags appear 89 90 . Technologists sometimes call this “selective transparency” or “granular disclosure.”
For example, Alice can prove she’s not transacting above her allowed limit without stating the exact amount
of her holdings or her identity – all the regulator sees is a proof that rules are met. This vision is not sci-fi;
it’s being prototyped in projects like Mastercard’s recent work on zero-knowledge for CBDC, or startups
enabling “regulated DeFi.” If successful, it addresses the main criticism of public blockchain finance (that it’s
either too opaque for regulators or too transparent for users, or somehow both!). It shows a path where
stablecoins could “have their cake and eat it too” – enjoy the openness and speed of blockchain, and
satisfy regulatory demands, and uphold privacy rights. So what? If stablecoins adopt such ZK identity
frameworks, it would represent an institutional breakthrough. The current financial system tends to treat
privacy and compliance as opposing forces in zero-sum tension. A ZK-enabled stablecoin system could
achieve something unprecedented: compliance with rules without mass surveillance. That is a qualitative
improvement over electronic banking, where compliance is achieved through heavy surveillance and data
collection (KYC documents, transaction monitoring, etc.). It means grandma could use a stablecoin to buy
groceries with the same privacy as cash, but if someone tries to launder money, the system can catch it –
ideally without revealing everyone else’s info. Achieving this would strongly validate stablecoins as the next-
gen financial infrastructure: one that is more efficient, more inclusive, and more protective of civil liberties.
It marries cutting-edge cryptography with everyday finance. And conceptually, it continues the trend of
transferring trust from institutions to technology (first stablecoins transferred trust of value to
code+collateral, now they might transfer trust of compliance to code+cryptography). In conclusion, the way
stablecoins handle identity and privacy will significantly influence their legacy. They have the potential to
set new standards for privacy in digital payments, which is a core pillar of a free society. If electronic
banking was about convenience and speed (but at the cost of creating large centralized databases of
personal finance data), stablecoin infrastructure can be about convenience, speed and personal
autonomy. That would indeed be a momentous upgrade.
Inequality and Development: Inclusion, Leapfrogging, and the
Digital Divide
Financial Inclusion – From M-Pesa to Global Stablecoins: A major promise of digital finance is to include
the “unbanked” – those without access to traditional banking – thereby reducing poverty and inequality.
Over the past decade, research on mobile money in developing countries provides encouraging
evidence. The landmark example is Kenya’s M-Pesa. Launched in 2007, it allowed anyone with a simple
mobile phone to send and receive money via SMS. By 2016, researchers Tavneet Suri and William Jack found
M-Pesa had “increased per capita consumption levels and lifted 194,000 households (2% of Kenyan
households) out of extreme poverty” 100 . Crucially, it had a particularly strong impact on women: an
estimated 185,000 women moved from subsistence farming to business occupations thanks to
mobile money access 101 . This demonstrates how digital payment infrastructure can empower people to
save, invest, and diversify incomes, especially women who gained more financial independence 102 103 .
The “M-Pesa model” – using ubiquitous mobile phones to offer basic financial services – has been replicated
in other countries (Bangladesh’s bKash, Pakistan’s Easypaisa, etc.), generally with positive outcomes in
12terms of convenience and sometimes formal savings. However, most such systems are national and often
closed loops (run by a telco or consortium, with the local currency). Stablecoins represent an extension of
this model to a global, open platform. They are to the smartphone and internet what M-Pesa was to
feature phones and SMS. In fact, many emerging-market users already treat stablecoins as a higher-tech M-
Pesa: a tool for remittances, saving in dollars, or transacting online where local money is unstable or
payment infrastructure weak. For example, Nigeria and other African countries have high stablecoin
usage for peer-to-peer transfers and commerce, precisely because a large young population is mobile-
native but underserved by banks 104 105 . The Africa Financial Summit this year discussed how
“stablecoins can help Africa leapfrog outdated payment rails and foster financial inclusion.” 104 In countries with
double or triple-digit inflation, even those with bank accounts often choose stablecoins to preserve value –
effectively giving ordinary people access to a stable savings instrument (the US dollar in digital form) that
was previously out of reach or dangerous to hold in cash. This helps protect wealth from being eroded,
which is a direct boon to poverty reduction. Remittances are another area: stablecoins can reduce fees
dramatically (from Western Union’s ~5-10% down to under 1% in many crypto remittance services) and
increase speed (minutes instead of days) 106 107 . The IMF notes “stablecoins could enable faster, cheaper
cross-border payments…some remittances cost up to 20%...blockchains can reduce costs” 106 108 . Cheaper
remittances mean more money in the hands of recipient families – a direct welfare improvement. A concrete
example: an immigrant in the US can send USDC to family in Latin America who then convert it to local
currency or use it via local crypto agents; this bypasses costly intermediaries. During the COVID-19
pandemic, in some countries where lockdowns shut banks or cash agents, people turned to digital dollars
as a lifeline for receiving aid or support. So what? If stablecoins can replicate and scale the successes of
mobile money, the impact on global development could be substantial. They offer a way for people in any
country to “access dollar liquidity outside of the U.S. banking system” 109 – both a benefit and a
geopolitical controversy. For individuals, it means not being solely at the mercy of local financial instability.
Importantly, stablecoins can knit together diasporas and domestic economies: a farmer in rural Guatemala
might receive stablecoin remittances from her son in New York directly on her phone, something neither
country’s banks made easy. This kind of leapfrogging of financial infrastructure mirrors how many
developing regions skipped landline phones and went straight to mobiles. The IMF explicitly observes:
“Many developing countries are already leapfrogging traditional banking with the expansion of mobile phones
and … digital money.” 110 111 . Stablecoins supercharge that trend by providing a common currency (USD)
and platform (internet/blockchain) that is not limited to one telecom or nation. It’s an infrastructure of
inclusion: anyone with a basic internet connection can download a wallet app and effectively have a “dollar
bank account” in minutes, often without onerous paperwork. Traditional electronic banking hasn’t achieved
that ubiquity – billions still lack bank accounts, but billions do have mobile internet now. Thus, stablecoins
can bring financial services to people who’ve been left out, at nearly zero marginal cost. That’s a profound
upgrade in the inclusiveness of the financial system.
The Digital Divide – Who Benefits, Who Might be Left Behind: While stablecoins can broaden access, we
must consider who might be excluded. The digital divide refers to the gap between those with easy access
to digital tech and those without. Stablecoins, by nature, require at least a device (smartphone or computer)
and internet connectivity. Globally, about 5 billion people have mobile internet access, but that leaves ~3
billion without, often among the poorest or in remote areas. Moreover, even among those with access,
there’s a skills divide – using crypto wallets can be non-intuitive for newcomers, and there are language and
literacy barriers. If stablecoins become a primary financial rail, there’s a risk the most marginalized (those
without phones, or who are not digitally literate) could be further marginalized. This is similar to
concerns from the rise of online banking: some older or rural folks struggled when branches closed in favor
of apps. However, there are mitigations. First, phone penetration is rapidly growing; cheap smartphones are
13proliferating. Many countries in sub-Saharan Africa already have ~50-60% smartphone usage and rising.
Second, innovations can bring stablecoins to basic phones – for example, through SMS interfaces or USSD
menus (some projects are working on “stablecoin via text message” to emulate M-Pesa’s approach). Also,
agent networks – local shops or kiosks where people can deposit or withdraw cash for digital value – can
be used with stablecoins as they are with mobile money 112 113 . The uploaded user guide lists ideas like
“Agent network for cash-to-stablecoin conversion in underserved areas” 113 . If such on/off-ramp networks
develop, even people without personal internet could use stablecoins via an intermediary (much like many
M-Pesa users rely on agents). In effect, a village store could function like a micro-bank: converting cash to a
stablecoin on the owner’s device that can then be sent cheaply to another village. Another consideration:
costs and fees. Currently, using stablecoins might involve blockchain fees which can sometimes spike
(Ethereum gas fees, etc.). Solutions include using cheaper networks or layer-2 scaling. Many stablecoin
transactions have moved to low-fee chains (like Tron or Solana) to cater to emerging market users with tiny
transaction sizes. As of 2025, an international USDT transfer on Tron costs a few cents – far less than a
remittance wire. Over time, technology tends to drive these costs down (and there’s competition among
blockchains to host stablecoin activity). So, the cost barrier is likely to keep falling. Perhaps the deeper
challenge is education and consumer protection. The unbanked may be more vulnerable to scams if dealing
with crypto – there have been instances of fraudulent “wallet apps” or Ponzi schemes targeting newbies. So
financial literacy efforts must accompany rollouts of stablecoin services in developing areas. This is not
unlike the early days of mobile money, which required community education on how to use PINs and avoid
sharing them, etc. Governments and NGOs have a role to play in safe adoption. So what? Acknowledging
the digital divide tempers the utopian view – stablecoins won’t automatically help everyone. But they greatly
lower the barriers to inclusion. Unlike building bank branches or ATM networks (which are expensive and
thus skip poor villages), extending stablecoin access is mainly a matter of network coverage and
affordable devices, which are improving yearly. In a sense, stablecoins hitch financial inclusion to the
broader trend of tech inclusion. If Starlink and similar initiatives succeed in bringing internet to remote
regions, stablecoin financial access comes along for the ride. One speculative but intriguing idea is that
stablecoins could motivate infrastructure: a government might push rural connectivity specifically to enable
modern financial services via stablecoins/CBDCs to its citizens (similar to how seeing the economic benefits
of M-Pesa led Kenya to ensure telecom coverage expanded). Ultimately, stablecoins can reach the “truly
unbanked” to the extent that digital tech reaches them. And given that two-thirds of unbanked adults globally
own a mobile phone (per World Bank Findex data), the potential is there. The development “so what” is that
stablecoins could accelerate progress toward SDG goals on financial inclusion. They provide a toolkit for
NGOs, fintechs, and social enterprises: e.g., distributing humanitarian cash aid directly as a token to
refugees who can hold it securely on a phone – reducing theft or diversion, and allowing easier accounting.
The American Red Cross, for instance, has piloted using stablecoins for aid in crisis zones where banking is
destroyed. Such use cases show stablecoins as an infrastructure for resilience: when the traditional
system is weak or compromised (be it by corruption, disaster, or hyperinflation), a stablecoin on a
decentralized network can keep commerce and aid flowing. That resiliency is itself a boost for equality – it
means vulnerable communities aren’t cut off from money flows when they need them most.
Leapfrogging Legacy Systems: The concept of “leapfrogging” in development economics refers to
skipping intermediate stages of technology. For example, many African countries moved from limited
telephone access straight to ubiquitous mobile phones, bypassing the expensive rollout of landlines. In
finance, a similar leapfrog may occur: instead of building dense branch networks, card payment
infrastructure, and mass credit card issuance (which took decades in the West), a developing economy could
jump to widespread mobile wallet and stablecoin use in a short span. There’s evidence this is happening.
Cambodia’s central bank launched Bakong, a DLT-based payments system, achieving high adoption
14without waiting for card penetration to catch up. In Nigeria, a huge portion of the population went from
cash to mobile/digital app-based transactions within a decade, spurred by fintech and, more recently,
crypto use amid currency issues. The Messari crypto report dubbed it “The Stablecoin Leapfrog”, noting that
“Emerging markets are rapidly adopting stablecoins to bypass traditional banking systems” due to user-friendly
apps and distrust in banks 114 115 . One could envision a future where, say, an African startup scene
builds on stablecoins and decentralized finance, offering loans and savings to people who never had
a bank account but do have a smartphone. That would skip the 20th-century model of branch-based
banking entirely. Leapfrogging also applies to cross-border integration. Many emerging markets are not
well-served by correspondent banking (some are “de-risked” out of global networks). Stablecoins allow them
to plug into the global dollar network instantly. CARICOM countries and African nations are eyeing
stablecoins as a way to integrate into global trade without fully relying on correspondent banks 109 .
One analyst wrote that for small countries, “stablecoins allow access to dollar liquidity outside U.S. banking –
both a benefit and a geopolitical risk”, hinting at a leapfrog that could undermine Western banking
dominance but help local economies function in dollars during crises 109 . Another aspect is efficiency
leapfrogging: stablecoins + smartphones can produce far lower transaction costs than legacy systems. A
McKinsey report estimated digital finance (including mobile money) could add $3.7 trillion to GDP of
emerging economies by 2025 through increased productivity and time savings – stablecoins turbocharge
that by enabling instant, automated payments and lending, globally. For example, a farmer could get a micro-
loan disbursed in a stablecoin via a smart contract after automatically proving collateral or identity through
their mobile – no local bank needed. This is speculative but within the realm of possibility as DeFi and TradFi
converge. So what? Leapfrogging with stablecoins suggests that late-developing countries might avoid
many infrastructure traps – they might not need to build extensive ATM networks, or wait for everyone to get
national ID and bank paperwork, or suffer from hard-currency shortages in banking. They can jump to a
model where a widely accepted stablecoin (likely USD) circulates digitally, and local fintechs build user-
friendly layers atop it (providing localized services, integration with retail, etc.). This could compress decades
of financial sector development into a few years of tech rollout. It also means these countries could “skip a
generation” of financial technology, with all the cost savings that entails. From a policy perspective, that’s
both exciting and challenging: exciting because it can drive growth and inclusion quickly, challenging
because regulators and institutions have to adjust to a new paradigm (e.g., managing monetary policy
when much of the money supply is in privately issued digital dollars). The experience of M-Pesa is
instructive: Kenya’s banking sector initially resisted it, then adapted and grew alongside it. We might see
incumbent banks in emerging markets either collaborate with stablecoin providers (issuing their own or
integrating them) or try to catch up with their own digital offerings. The ones that adapt could extend
services to millions more; the ones that don’t might lose relevance. For the thesis, this leapfrogging
underscores how stablecoins aren’t just making existing systems marginally better – they are allowing
entirely new systems to emerge in places that lacked financial infrastructure. That’s arguably a more
significant upgrade than what electronic banking did in rich countries (which was mostly digitizing existing
account relationships). It’s more analogous to how cheap cellular tech brought communication to villages
that never had phone lines at all. When you bring stable, internet-native money to a population that never
had reliable banking, the leap in capabilities is dramatic. This can spur entrepreneurship (e.g., freelancers in
a developing country can now easily get paid in stablecoin from global clients), improve livelihoods, and
integrate these economies into global commerce on fairer terms. Of course, it raises issues of sovereignty –
a world of dollar stablecoins could reduce use of local currencies. But some argue that might discipline bad
policies and provide a more stable unit for daily life 26 . In any case, for individual welfare, being able to
hold a stablecoin beats holding rapidly inflating cash under the mattress.
15Measurable Impacts – Empirical Data and RCTs: As of now, stablecoins per se haven’t been around long
enough for extensive academic impact evaluations (no long-run RCTs specifically on stablecoin distribution
have been published to our knowledge). But we can extrapolate from related digital finance studies. A 2021
meta-analysis of financial inclusion interventions (digital and otherwise) found small but positive effects
on poverty reduction on average 116 117 . Digital finance particularly tends to improve consumption
smoothing and lower transaction costs. For instance, randomised trials of giving out free basic mobile
money accounts showed increased resilience to shocks for households. We can anticipate that stablecoins,
by lowering cost and increasing access even further, would amplify such effects. One could imagine a future
study where a village is randomly encouraged to use stablecoin wallets (with training and perhaps
subsidies) and another similar village isn’t, and after a year the former might show higher savings, more
remittances received, etc. Given the evidence from M-Pesa and others, it’s reasonable to expect positive
outcomes. Another crucial dimension is cost savings. The World Bank tracks remittance costs – global
average ~6.5%. If stablecoins cut that to say 3%, that difference puts billions of extra dollars into the hands
of low-income families each year (remittances to developing countries were about \$626 billion in 2022, so a
3.5 percentage-point reduction saves ~$22 billion annually for recipients). That’s akin to a major aid
program, except it happens through technology efficiency. Moreover, stablecoins can help small businesses.
Think of a small exporter in an emerging market: instead of waiting weeks for payment and losing 5% to
forex fees, they could receive a stablecoin immediately upon shipment, and either use it to pay suppliers or
convert at a crypto exchange locally at a tighter spread. This improves their cash flow and profitability,
potentially allowing them to grow and hire more. These micro improvements accumulate economy-wide. As
one Morgan Stanley report put it, stablecoins and related innovations are “modernizing financial
infrastructure” and could boost GDP by streamlining trade and lowering friction 118 . So what? The macro
implication is that countries who embrace this leap might accelerate economic development, much like
those that quickly adopted mobile phones saw boosts in growth. Those who hesitate might fall behind. We
already see some governments proactively exploring stablecoins or integrated digital currency frameworks
(e.g., Brazil’s central bank is piloting a tokenized real that can interoperate with stablecoins, aiming
to make their financial system more efficient 119 120 ). This competitive dynamic underscores that
stablecoins are now part of the development toolkit. The World Economic Forum’s 2026 agenda includes
stablecoins as a topic for expanding access to the underserved 121 , indicating high-level recognition.
Summing up, stablecoins hold promise to reduce inequality by leveling access to a stable unit of account
and modern payments. But they must be implemented with care to avoid creating a new underclass of
“digitally invisible” people. If done right, stablecoins can help fulfill the long-standing goal of universal
financial access. That is not just a fintech improvement – it’s a societal upgrade on par with bringing
electricity or telecom infrastructure to everyone. Few innovations since electronic banking can claim that
potential. Electronic banking widened access to some extent (e.g., microfinance and mobile banking
helped), but stablecoins can universalize it across borders. This transformative potential is central to why
stablecoins are viewed as a significant infrastructure advance: they could knit the world’s unbanked into the
fabric of global finance in a way traditional banking has not managed to do in decades of effort. And that,
ultimately, is a humanitarian and economic boon that strengthens the thesis of stablecoins as a
revolutionary financial infrastructure.
Key Findings and “So What” Summary: Across monetary theory, network economics, infrastructure,
identity/privacy, and development, our deep dive yields consistent themes. Stablecoins fuse the credibility
of fiat with the technology of crypto to create a novel monetary form that challenges old assumptions
(Hayek’s private money vision partially realized, new categories of money beyond fiat/commodity) 11 10 .
They shift power and profit in the monetary system (private seigniorage in the tens of billions 39 40 ,
potential loss of monetary control by states 26 ). They operate on network dynamics that could entrench
16them as global standards (exponential adoption curves, Metcalfe effects making them more useful as they
grow 43 47 ). They upgrade the ledger infrastructure, making money transfer as interoperable and
instant as data on the internet – a leap analogous to containerization in shipping or the telegraph in
communication 71 64 . They bring forth the possibility of restoring privacy through cryptography in a
digital age, addressing the tension between security and liberty by engineering compliance that doesn’t spy
on everyone 84 89 . And they offer developing regions a chance to leapfrog, plugging into global
commerce and stable value without waiting for legacy systems to trickle down 110 122 . In concrete terms:
stablecoin transactions have exploded to $27+ trillion a year 47 , outpacing Visa; countries with high
inflation see stablecoins acting as de facto stable currency for daily use 22 ; experimental evidence from
mobile money suggests similar digital finance tools lift people from poverty 100 ; and technological pilots
show that zero-knowledge identities can square the circle of privacy vs regulation 84 89 .
All these pieces point to stablecoins being more than a speculative crypto fad – they constitute an
infrastructural innovation with wide-ranging economic and social implications. Much like electronic
banking (ATMs, ACH, online accounts) transformed finance in the late 20th century – enabling global
commerce growth, card networks, and round-the-clock markets – stablecoins in the 21st century are poised
to transform finance again. They promise an even more integrated and user-centric system: money that’s
always on, borderless, and programmable; access that’s democratized; ledgers that are unified yet respect
individual privacy. Challenges remain (regulatory clarity, managing risks, bridging the digital divide), but the
intellectual foundations laid out here provide strong support for the thesis. Stablecoins can indeed be seen
as “the most significant financial infrastructure upgrade since electronic banking” – not because they
replace the dollar or euro, but because they upgrade the rails and rules by which money moves, potentially
making the global financial system more efficient, inclusive, and innovation-friendly than ever before.
