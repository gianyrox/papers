The Global Paradigm Shift of Stablecoins –
Research Findings
1. Real-World Remittance Cost Comparison
• Stablecoins Slash Remittance Fees: Traditional remittances cost ~6.6% of principal on average (Q1
2024) for sending $200 1 . Stablecoin-based transfers can drop fees below 1%, settling in minutes.
Example: MoneyGram’s USDC-on-Stellar service charges under 1% and completes transfers near-
instantly 2 , versus 3–7 days and ~6% via banks or MTOs (Western Union, etc.). This aligns with UN
SDG targets to cut remittance fees to 3% 1 2 .
• Corridor Case Studies: In U.S.–Mexico (world’s largest corridor, ~$60B/yr), sending $300 via a bank/
WU costs ~5–7% and takes hours-days. By contrast, a USDC transfer on Tron costs only a few cents in
network fees, and local crypto exchanges like Bitso enable near-real-time MXN payout for ~1% fee
3
4 . Similar savings show in Europe–Africa lanes: e.g., sending €200 to Nigeria can exceed 8%
fee traditionally, but using USDT (widely traded P2P in Nigeria) often costs <2% total (including on/
off-ramp spreads) 5 6 .
• On/Off-Ramp Cost Breakdown: The blockchain transfer itself is usually trivial (e.g. Stellar fees are
fractions of a cent 7 ; Tron fees after recent cuts average <$0.10 8 9 ). Most costs come from
on/off-ramps – converting fiat to stablecoin and vice versa 3 10 . These can range 0.5–3% each
side 11 . Competition is driving these down: dedicated remittance fintechs partner with local banks
and mobile wallets to reduce conversion spreads to just ~1% 12 4 . In 2025, Western Union’s CEO
noted that stablecoin settlement can improve FX rates in low-liquidity corridors and “move money
faster across borders” – seeing it as an opportunity, not a threat 13 14 .
• Speed and Reliability Gains: A typical SWIFT wire to emerging markets takes 2–5 days with
uncertain arrival time. Stablecoin transfers settle in 1–2 minutes on networks like Tron or Solana,
with finality. As one cross-border CEO explained, using local-bank-integrated stablecoins can achieve
120-second end-to-end transfers (local currency→stablecoin→local currency) 4 15 . The difference
in speed is stark – minutes vs. days – which eliminates timing risk. Western Union’s pilot reports
instant partner settlements and improved uptime using crypto rails 16 17 . The fast stablecoin
model is “on par or better” in many exotic corridors, whereas legacy channels suffer frequent delays
18
3 .
• Counterintuitive Finding: Stablecoins aren’t always cheaper in every corridor. A 2025 FXC study
found some well-served routes (e.g. US–India) already have sub-3% costs via fintechs, and
stablecoin alternatives were not significantly cheaper there 18 19 . The big impact is in high-
cost corridors (Africa, S. America, smaller diasporas) where legacy fees remain 5–10% 20 21 . Those
are the lanes where crypto on average outperforms (and indeed where over 50% of surveyed
recipients in Africa now use crypto for remittances 22 ). Lesson: Stablecoins are a game-changer for
corridors that need it most, while in already-efficient routes they compete on speed and 24/7
availability more than price.
2. Scale of Adoption – Hard Numbers
• Stablecoin Volume Rivaling Major Payment Networks: In 2024, stablecoins facilitated $27.6
trillion in on-chain transaction volume, exceeding Visa + Mastercard’s volume by ~7.7% 23 24 .
By late 2025, annual stablecoin volumes have been cited above $50 trillion 25 26 . This tremendous
throughput – much of it driven by exchange/trading activity – underscores that stablecoins are no
longer niche. For context, PayPal’s 2024 volume (~$1.4T) was <5% of stablecoin volume 27 . However,
high volume also reflects recycling between exchanges and DeFi; 90%+ of stablecoin flow (by
value) is between larger investors/institutions (traders, OTC desks, etc.), not retail commerce.
• Market Capitalization & Supply: The aggregate stablecoin market cap hovers around $125–130
billion (2025), dominated by USDT (~$80B) and USDC (~$30B) 28 29 . Growth has plateaued since
2022’s crypto downturn and regulatory pressure – it’s up only modestly from ~$100B in early 2022.
But projections are bullish: a 2025 21Shares analysis suggests total supply could exceed $300B by
2027 if regulatory clarity unlocks more institutional demand 30 . Notably, over 99% of stablecoin
value is USD-pegged 29 – non-USD stablecoins (EUR, GBP, etc.) remain <1% of the pie, reflecting
the USD’s dominance (see Section 4).
• User Base and Wallets: Over 160 million blockchain addresses hold stablecoins as of mid-2025
31 . Industry estimates (which likely count many custodial users) put the number of people using
stablecoins at 50–75 million globally – and growing fast in emerging markets. Circle’s CEO noted an
“estimated 500 million+ digital wallets” with stablecoin functionality in 2025 32 33 , though this
likely counts every exchange account. What’s clear: adoption has broadened from crypto traders to
everyday users in places like Nigeria (≈$22B in stablecoin transactions Jul’23–Jun’24) 34 and
Turkey (where stablecoin volume equated to ~4.3% of GDP) 35 36 . In Nigeria, stablecoins make
up 43% of all on-chain transaction value now 37 38 , indicating heavy use for savings and payments
amidst Naira instability.
• Country-Specific Usage: Emerging markets lead in retail stablecoin adoption. Nigeria, Brazil,
Turkey, Argentina, Vietnam consistently rank high in usage metrics 39 40 . For example, Nigeria
saw $59B in crypto value received in one year (mid-2023 to mid-2024), with stablecoins accounting
for ~40% 41 42 . In Turkey, where inflation rages, stablecoins (mostly USDT) are so prevalent that
their volume reached 4.3% of GDP in 2023, the highest ratio worldwide 36 43 . Meanwhile, in the
U.S. and Europe, stablecoin use is growing but stays mostly within crypto trading and DeFi circles –
though surveys show 29% of Fortune-500 executives are now interested in stablecoin
applications (up from 8% a year prior) 44 45 .
• Retail vs. Institutional Mix: On-chain data suggests retail-sized transfers (<$10k) comprise under
2% of stablecoin volume by value, but a much larger share by count of transactions 46 42 . Large
transfers (>$1M) dominate volume (e.g., exchanges shuffling liquidity). Still, Chainalysis reports
that in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, a significant portion of stablecoin activity comes from small
and medium businesses using them for trade and payments, not just trading 47 48 . This indicates
an evolving user base. Counterintuitive finding: Western economies also see stablecoins deeply
integrated in crypto markets – in fact, in Western Europe stablecoins made up ~52% of all crypto
transaction volume (2022–24) 49 , hinting that even where banking is strong, stablecoins have
become the liquidity vehicle within the crypto ecosystem. The broad picture: stablecoins are the de
facto liquidity and settlement layer of the crypto economy, and are rapidly bleeding into
mainstream use cases where they solve real frictions (high inflation, capital controls, slow banks).
3. Competitors & Alternatives (UPI, PIX, FedNow, SEPA, M-Pesa, etc.)
• Domestic Instant Payments (UPI, PIX) vs. Stablecoins: Systems like India’s UPI and Brazil’s PIX
offer free or near-free 24/7 instant transfers, but only domestically. UPI handled 12 billion+
transactions in Jan 2024 (INR 18 trillion ≈ $220B) 50 51 – a scale stablecoins haven’t reached in
daily retail use. Cost: UPI is zero-fee to consumers (subsidized) 52 53 , while FedNow charges
~$0.045 per transfer to banks 52 54 (likely passed on in account fees). Stablecoins, by contrast,
typically incur a ~0.1% spread or a small flat fee via an exchange on each end. For purely domestic
payments with good banking access, local systems usually win on convenience – e.g. an Indian
paying a merchant via UPI QR code is seamless and free, whereas doing so via USDC would be
clunkier (conversion steps, crypto app) and potentially taxable.
• Cross-Border Capability: The major advantage of stablecoins is built-in cross-border functionality.
Networks like FedNow or SEPA Instant do not cross national borders or currency regimes – they
stop at the water’s edge 55 56 . PIX is phenomenal within Brazil (89% of adults have used it as of
2024) and cut merchant payment costs by 85% vs. cards 57 58 , but it “lacks cross-border
functionality” by design 55 . In practice, sending money from USA to India via UPI still requires an
intermediary (SWIFT or a specialist service). Stablecoins fill this gap: one shared ledger for sender
and receiver regardless of country. A Kenyan freelancer can receive USDT from a US client in minutes
– something not possible with domestic-only rails. Quote: “With stablecoins, there are no payment
cut‑off windows… no reversed payments – you can settle anytime” noted Circle’s team, comparing it
to siloed bank systems 59 60 .
• Inclusion & Accessibility: M-Pesa (Kenya) revolutionized mobile money, but it’s mostly confined to
Kenya and a few countries and runs on telco infrastructure. Stablecoins can ride on the open
internet, potentially reaching anyone with a smartphone. Importantly, stablecoins don’t require a
bank account – similar to mobile money’s appeal for the unbanked. However, stablecoin usage still
requires internet and some technical savvy or intermediaries. M-Pesa has physical agent networks
for cash-in/out; stablecoins are developing analogs (see MoneyGram’s crypto cash-out or Latin
American retail integrations). In terms of privacy, cash and many domestic systems (by virtue of
being within one jurisdiction) offer some privacy, whereas public stablecoin ledgers broadcast
transactions (unless privacy tech is added – see Section 7).
• Programmability & Interoperability: Stablecoins are programmable money – one can embed
them in smart contracts, something UPI/SEPA can’t natively do. For instance, a stablecoin can
facilitate an escrow that auto-releases on condition, or micro-payments streaming by the second.
Traditional rails are catching up (India’s UPI added AutoPay for recurring, but it’s limited to certain
use cases). Stablecoins are multi-platform by nature – a USDC can be used in a lending DApp, a
game, a remittance, etc., whereas each traditional system serves one domain (M-Pesa for P2P mobile
transfers, SEPA for bank transfers, etc.). This composability is a key competitive edge that could
unlock novel services.
• Speed & Finality: Many domestic systems are instant or near-instant now (FedNow, UPI, PIX all
settle in seconds). Stablecoins on fast chains (Tron ~3s block time, Solana ~0.4s) are similarly quick.
The difference: stablecoin transfers are final and irrevocable typically within 1 block confirmation,
whereas banking systems, though “instant” to users, still have potential clawbacks/reversals (e.g.
ACH or even PIX can be reversed for fraud). This finality is a double-edged sword: great for
settlement assurance, but bad for mistaken transactions. Notable quote: Visa’s head of crypto likened
stablecoin networks to always-on systems that “operate around the clock… no payment cut-off
windows” enabling continuous business 61 62 .
• Counterintuitive Finding: Domestic systems and stablecoins are more complementary than
outright competitors. Where domestic digital payments are robust (e.g. India, EU), stablecoin
growth has been slower or focused on crypto trading. But stablecoins shine as a bridge between these
domestic networks. We may see a future where a user’s UPI app seamlessly converts INR to a USD
stablecoin behind the scenes, sends to another country, and the recipient’s PIX app converts it to
BRL – stablecoins as the glue. In other words, rather than displacing well-adopted local solutions,
stablecoins might connect them globally. Indeed, Mastercard and others are piloting stablecoin
links between national systems 63 . The irony is that while crypto aimed to bypass banks, its
greatest payment impact might be augmenting the existing financial plumbing to be more
interoperable.
4. Dollar Hegemony – The USD Question
• USD Dominance in Stablecoins: The stablecoin boom has thus far reinforced dollar hegemony. Over
99% of stablecoin supply is USD-pegged 29 . Non-USD stablecoins (EUR, CNY, gold, etc.) are
rounding errors by comparison. So as stablecoins spread globally, they spread dollars. “Every
compliant stablecoin must be backed by reserves held in dollars… As stablecoins are adopted globally…
they become a continuous engine of demand for dollar-based assets,” notes an AIER analysis 64 65 .
This dynamic mirrors the Eurodollar era – in the 60s–70s, offshore USD deposits (Eurodollars) grew
outside US regulation but ultimately entrenched USD usage worldwide. Today’s “crypto-dollars”
(USDT, USDC, etc.) are seen as digital eurodollars: they circulate offshore (often outside direct Fed
oversight) yet bolster dollar ubiquity as a trade and savings currency 66 67 .
• Benefits to Dollar Primacy: Policymakers note that if USD stablecoins become the standard, it
“fortifies dollar primacy” in the digital era 68 . E.g., a Vietnamese importer using USDC instead of
USD bank wires is still using the greenback. Morgan Stanley estimates broad stablecoin adoption
could generate trillions in new demand for US Treasuries (since reserves are in T-bills) 69 . U.S.
lawmakers have caught on – a recent U.S. Executive Order explicitly promoted “dollar sovereignty
through stablecoins” 70 . The subtext: better the world use dollars on crypto rails than let a non-dollar
(say, a digital yuan) take that role 68 .
• Risks & Challenges – “Digital Dollarization”: International bodies (IMF, BIS) warn of currency
substitution risks. If people in weaker-currency countries all adopt USD stablecoins, those nations
effectively lose monetary policy control and seigniorage. The IMF noted that stablecoins can
enable “digital dollarization,” reducing demand for local currency as a store of value and
medium of exchange 66 71 . This echoes historical dollarization in Latin America, now
turbocharged – a smartphone with USDT can replace holding Argentine pesos, accelerating capital
flight from unstable currencies 67 72 . For governments, that means a shriveled tax base
(transactions go dark/offshore) and loss of the “printing press” revenue. Case: In Lebanon’s economic
crisis, a significant informal adoption of USDT and USDC is occurring, undermining the Lebanese
pound – a glimpse of what widespread stablecoin use looks like under a failing fiat regime.
• Global Perspectives: The BIS has called for strong regulation to prevent stablecoins from fragmenting
the monetary system or importing foreign monetary policy. They prefer central bank digital currencies
(CBDCs) as a safer alternative (see Section 5). The World Bank and G20 have been more open,
seeing a role for USD stablecoins in enhancing remittances if properly supervised 48 73 . Notably,
some governments are already integrating stablecoins: e.g. El Salvador’s Chivo wallet uses USDT
for internal USD liquidity (since Salvadorans use USD as legal tender). And Hong Kong is exploring
permitting USD stablecoins under its regulations – effectively embracing the dollar’s digital form.
4Meanwhile, China’s stance is cautious: they view global USD stablecoin growth as strengthening
dollar influence at the expense of RMB internationalization, one reason they pushed e-CNY early.
• Historical Parallels: Observers liken today’s stablecoin growth to the post-WWII Eurodollar market.
Then, as now, U.S. regulators were initially worried – Eurodollars were outside their purview.
Similarly, US regulators fret over offshore stablecoins (like Tether in Hong Kong). But historically,
Eurodollars ultimately reinforced USD dominance and the U.S. learned to work with them.
Counterpoint: Stablecoins could also reduce reliance on dollars if, say, commodity-backed or non-USD
coins gained traction – but so far, no non-USD stablecoin has achieved significant network
effects. (Even IMF’s own report finds USD stablecoins overwhelmingly used in emerging markets
74
67 .)
• For vs. Against USD Stablecoins: For: They expand access to dollars globally (good for people in
high-inflation countries) and cement USD as the standard unit of account in crypto commerce.
Against: They complicate domestic monetary policy and could facilitate illicit flows or sanctions
evasion by offering anonymous dollar value transfer outside the banking system 75 76 . The U.S.
Treasury is balancing these: it wants dollar stablecoins to flourish under U.S. oversight (hence bills
like the Stablecoin TRUST Act), while also ramping up enforcement against illicit uses. Notably, even
U.S. adversaries sometimes utilize USD stablecoins (e.g. reports of Russians using Tether to
bypass currency restrictions) – an ironic twist where dollar tokens undermine certain sanctions yet
keep transactions in USD. Geopolitically, stablecoins raise the question: Will the dollar’s digital
proliferation extend its reign or sow new vulnerabilities? So far, evidence points to the former – with
dollar stablecoins “exporting currency infrastructure” much like the U.S. exported the internet,
locking in its influence 68 .
5. CBDC vs Stablecoin Reality Check
• e-CNY (China’s Digital Yuan): China’s CBDC is by far the largest: by Nov 2025 it had processed 3.4
billion transactions worth ¥16.7 trillion (~$2.3T) since launch 77 . However, relative to China’s
enormous payments market, adoption is moderate – ~260 million users (primarily via government
promotion) out of a billion adults 78 . Usage tends to be for small retail payments; the average
transaction was only ~¥428 ($60) in 2025 79 . Notably, the e-CNY hasn’t crossed borders
meaningfully (only small pilots with Hong Kong and Thailand). User feedback indicates privacy
concerns and limited incremental benefit vs. Alipay/WeChat Pay as hurdles to broader uptake 80 .
Indeed, authorities had to incentivize use via lotteries and salaries. Bottom line: large-scale in
volume, but not (yet) replacing cash or Alipay in daily life. By contrast, USDT is heavily used in China’s
underground economy for capital flight – something e-CNY cannot address.
• eNaira (Nigeria): A cautionary tale – launched Oct 2021 as Africa’s first CBDC, adoption has been
minuscule. As of March 2024, eNaira in circulation was only 0.5% of Nigeria’s physical currency in
circulation 81 82 . Fewer than 1 million people (~0.5% of population) actively use it. Nigerians
largely ignored eNaira due to low trust in the central bank, poor user experience, and the
availability of alternatives (bank apps, and ironically, dollar stablecoins via P2P) 81 83 . Even
aggressive measures – like Nigeria’s cash withdrawal limits in 2023 – failed to drive significant eNaira
uptake. In parallel, Nigeria’s crypto usage (e.g. USDT on Binance P2P) skyrocketed, highlighting that
people opted for stablecoins over the official CBDC. The eNaira’s struggles illustrate that simply
issuing a CBDC doesn’t guarantee use if it doesn’t solve a clear problem or if trust is lacking.
• Jamaica (Jam-Dex) & Others: Jamaica’s Jam-Dex (launched late 2022) saw extremely slow uptake –
by late 2023, only J$257 million (≈$1.6M) CBDC in circulation, a mere 0.11% of Jamaica’s money
supply 84 85 . Despite the government literally airdropping $16 worth of Jam-Dex to the first 100k
5users as an incentive, Jamaicans haven’t embraced it 86 87 . The central bank found people either
didn’t see the value over cash or were deterred by needing to open new wallet accounts with banks
88
89 . Similarly, the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar (world’s first CBDC) has had only limited usage on its
islands. In contrast, USDT is popular in some of these same small economies among crypto-savvy
users. Quote: Jamaica’s central bank governor admitted in 2024 the “lack of genuine consumer
adoption” but said they’d continue pushing awareness 90 .
• User Experience & Privacy: A recurring theme – many CBDCs offer no advantage over existing
digital money except perhaps not requiring a bank account. But even that is debatable: eNaira and
Jam-Dex wallets had to be linked to verified IDs (in Jamaica’s case, initially one had to go through a
specific bank) 88 91 . In contrast, cash and stablecoins can be transacted more anonymously.
Indeed, surveys show public wariness about government visibility: a 2022 BIS survey found
anonymity was a top requested feature for CBDCs, which most central banks are reluctant to fully
grant. In China, e-CNY wallets have tiered limits – small transactions can be semi-anonymous, but
anything substantial requires full name ID, making people worry about surveillance. Stablecoins,
despite being on public ledgers, ironically offer practical privacy via pseudonymity – your government
might not easily trace your USDC usage unless they devote effort, whereas with CBDC they could
have direct logs. This privacy angle is a double-edged sword: it’s precisely why central banks (and
certain public figures) push back on privately-run stablecoins (concern over illicit use), while users in
authoritarian regimes might favor stablecoins for the same reason.
• Cross-Border and Innovation: No retail CBDC today is broadly cross-border. Projects like mBridge
(connecting e-CNY with other Asian CBDCs) are still pilots. By contrast, stablecoins have naturally
flowed across borders for years (over $hf billion of USDT moves between continents daily). Even
central bankers acknowledge that “CBDCs alone won’t solve cross-border frictions without
interoperability” – and achieving that among sovereign digital currencies is as much a political
challenge as a technical one. In innovation, many CBDCs are technically less flexible than stablecoins.
For example, programmability: central banks are cautious to allow complex smart contracts on
CBDC ledgers due to risks. Private stablecoins live on Turing-complete blockchains like Ethereum,
allowing composability in DeFi, etc. This has led some analysts to dub stablecoins the “sandbox” or
“innovation frontier” for digital money, whereas CBDCs are deliberately conservative. A colorful
contrast: Terra’s collapse (see Section 8) – a dramatic private stablecoin failure – was chaotic but
also instructive technologically; no central bank would ever experiment so recklessly with an official
currency.
• Reality Check – Who’s Winning?: Two years ago, many assumed CBDCs would quickly eclipse
stablecoins once issued. Reality: stablecoins grew to >$125B while major CBDCs like eNaira
stagnated 81 84 . Even within China, usage of USD₮ (Tether) by citizens (for gray-market currency
exchange) likely exceeds e-CNY usage by value – though exact figures are hard to pin down. The IMF,
BIS now urge co-existence: regulation for stablecoins plus development of CBDCs, serving different
user preferences. Notable quote: “We see stablecoins as a game-changer…providing faster, more
affordable alternative to traditional remittances,” said Absa Bank’s Digital Assets lead, contrasting with
slower CBDC progress 48 92 . In sum, stablecoins have sprinted ahead in real-world uptake
despite zero official status, whereas CBDCs, backed by state power, have had a sluggish start. The
race isn’t over – a successful big-economy launch (e.g., a digital euro or FedCBDC) could change
momentum – but as of 2025, the score is clearly in favor of stablecoins in terms of adoption and
utility delivered.
6. Tether (USDT) Deep Dive – Reserves, Risks, Revenue
• Market Share & Scale: Tether’s USDT remains the largest stablecoin (~$86B circulating), making
up ~2/3 of all stablecoin value. Its dominance even increased after competitors like BUSD were
phased out. USDT’s ubiquity is such that Tron-based USDT alone now processes about $24.6B in
daily transfers (nearly 7× Ethereum’s stablecoin volume) 8 93 . Tether’s scale presents systemic
implications: it’s “too big to fail” for crypto markets. A shock to USDT (loss of peg or sudden
redemption freeze) could trigger a broad crypto liquidity crisis – exchanges, DeFi protocols, and
funds worldwide heavily rely on it as quote and collateral asset.
• Reserves & Composition: Tether claims 100% reserves backing, disclosed via quarterly attestations
(not full audits) 94 . As of Q4 2025, Tether reported $192.9B in assets vs $186.5B USDT liabilities
94
95 , indicating ~$6.4B in excess reserves (capital buffer). The bulk of reserves are in U.S.
Treasuries and cash equivalents – $141.6B in T-bills and overnight repo 95 96 . This makes Tether
a massive holder of US debt (analysts noted Tether would rank among the top foreign central banks
in Treasury holdings). It has $17.4B in “precious metals” (gold) 97 98 – roughly 670 tonnes of
gold, which quietly makes Tether one of the world’s biggest gold holders. It also holds about $8.4B
in Bitcoin (down slightly after BTC’s price drop in late 2025) 99 100 . The controversial part: $17B in
secured loans outstanding 101 . These are likely loans to affiliates or other crypto firms (Tether won’t
fully disclose) and represent an increase from ~$5B a year prior – raising questions of risk if
borrowers default. Notably, Tether eliminated all commercial paper by end-2022 after scrutiny,
moving into safer instruments (T-bills). Transparency gap: No full audit means we trust Tether and
its Cayman accountant’s snapshot 102 103 . Quote: “Our figures are a one-day attestation…not an
audit” Tether’s report reminds readers 102 103 , underscoring that we only see what Tether
discloses. This lack of a Big-4 audit keeps many institutions away from USDT.
• Profitability – “Printing Money”: With reserves mostly in yielding assets, Tether has become a cash
machine. In 2025, with interest rates ~5%, Tether likely earned $9–10 billion in interest income,
making it one of the most profitable entities in crypto 104 105 . For context, it reportedly made $5.2B
revenue in 2025 – about 42% of revenue of all crypto protocols combined 106 107 – and net profits
over $10B 108 109 . This exceeds the profits of many global banks and even some Big Tech firms.
They’ve used some of this to build a capital cushion (excess reserves) and even to invest in unrelated
ventures (Tether is funding bitcoin mining in Uruguay, and acquired a stake in a German bank).
Tether has essentially monetized the float of the crypto economy – critics say it’s like a central bank
printing money and buying assets, except it’s in private hands accruing the seigniorage.
• Legal and Regulatory Risks: Tether’s history is colored with regulatory issues. In 2021 it settled with
NYAG for $18.5M over misrepresenting reserves 94 (finding that at one point in 2017, Tether had
virtually no reserves for a while). It’s under investigation by the U.S. Justice Department for potential
bank fraud (stemming from early banking tactics) – though no charges yet. No U.S. license: If U.S.
stablecoin legislation comes, Tether might be locked out unless it dramatically improves
transparency or submits to U.S. oversight. Meanwhile, in 2023–24 Tether faced lawsuits alleging it
contributed to market manipulation in 2017. Operational risks: Its banking relationships – through
Bahamian and Asian banks – are somewhat opaque; during the 2023 banking crisis (Silicon Valley
Bank), USDT briefly traded at a premium as USDC faltered, highlighting how markets view Tether as
riskier (in past crises it’s traded at a discount on fear). Tether also has keys to freeze USDT (and has
cooperated with law enforcement to freeze ~$835M of USDT related to crime through 2023). This has
helped victims recover funds 110 , but also underscores centralization.
• Concentration & Dependency: Tether’s circulation is heavily concentrated on Tron’s network –
over 50% of USDT is on Tron as of 2025 93 28 . Binance and other Asian exchanges favor Tron-USDT
7for its low fees, meaning a significant chunk of USDT liquidity depends on Tron’s reliability. Tron
itself is centralized (27 “Super Representatives”) and closely tied to Justin Sun – raising a single-point-
of-failure worry. Tether is also concentrated in terms of holders: on-chain analysis shows maybe
~400 wallets (exchanges, market makers) hold the majority of USDT. This clustering could amplify
shocks – e.g., if a top holder (like an exchange) faced distress and suddenly redeemed billions, Tether
would need to liquidate assets fast. Tether says it maintains excess liquidity and short durations to
handle redemptions 95 96 . Indeed, after FTX’s collapse, Tether met ~$7B of redemptions in 48
hours, reportedly without issue – a positive sign of resiliency【source: Tether Q4 2022 report】.
• Systemic Role & Criticisms: Some economists call Tether a “shadow central bank” of crypto – yet
without lender-of-last-resort or insurance backstops that real central banks have. Its growth poses
potential systemic risk: if Tether broke peg, the cascade could trigger fire-sales of Treasuries (to meet
redemptions) and spill into traditional markets 111 112 . On the flip side, Tether has shown an ability
to act quickly: after the Wormhole bridge hack (2022), Tether swiftly froze ~$33M of USDT the
hacker tried to use 113 . However, Tether and Circle were later criticized for not freezing scammer
funds unless officially requested – highlighting tension between law enforcement cooperation vs.
decentralization ideals 110 114 . Notable quote: Responding to fears, CTO Paolo Ardoino often
tweets “Tether is 100% backed and stress-tested” and even teased getting a full audit “soon,” but
skeptics remain. Confidence level: Medium. Tether has weathered many storms and reduced its risk
assets, making it arguably safer in 2025 than ever. Yet its opacity, loan assets, and reliance on key
individuals (its Bahamas-based bankers, etc.) keep confidence below “High.” The coming years will
likely force more transparency – or users may gradually rotate to fully regulated alternatives (as seen
with some institutions shifting from USDT to USDC). Bottom line: Tether is hugely profitable and
systemically important, but still operates with a thinner margin of trust than one would like for an
~$186B financial entity 94
95 .
7. Privacy Tech – State of the Art (zkKYC, Privacy-Preserving
Stablecoins)
• The Dilemma: Stablecoins ride public blockchains – by default, every transaction is traceable. This is
great for auditability but bad for financial privacy. Today, if Alice pays Bob in USDC, anyone can see
that address A paid address B $X, potentially deanonymizing them. Traditional finance, in contrast, is
private to the public (though banks see your info). The emerging solution: zero-knowledge proofs
(ZK) and related privacy tech to allow verification of compliance or identity without revealing
personal details 115 116 .
• zkKYC and Verifiable Credentials: zkKYC means using ZK proofs to prove “I am KYC-ed” or “I’m not
on a sanctions list” without exposing who you are. In Oct 2025, fintech Tria integrated a zkKYC
system by Billions Network, letting its stablecoin wallet users privately verify attributes (age,
residency, etc.) 117 116 . Quote: “Regulators want proof, users want privacy – zkKYC delivers
both,” said Tria’s CEO 118 119 . This technology was piloted by HSBC and Sony Bank in 2024 120
121 , showing some traditional players are keen. The approach typically involves verifiable
credentials: a trusted issuer (say a KYC provider) issues an encrypted credential to your wallet (e.g.
“Verified: user is U.S. resident and not on OFAC list”). When a compliance check is needed, you
present a ZK proof derived from that credential rather than revealing your actual ID. This preserves
privacy while satisfying regulations that transactions only involve vetted parties.
• Privacy-Preserving Stablecoins: A few projects are making stablecoin transactions confidential.
Aleo (a ZK-based L1) partnered with Circle and Paxos in 2023 to pilot USDCx – a wrapped USDC
with “banking-level privacy” 122 . USDCx on Aleo uses ZK proofs so that transfers are encrypted by
8default (only the transacting parties know details), but there are compliance backdoors for
regulators if needed 123 124 . This is basically like a digital cash token: public can’t see it, but it’s fully
collateralized by real USDC off-chain and can be redeemed. Another example: Stellar’s zkTokens
concept to enable private asset transfers on Stellar while still allowing selective disclosure 125 . We
also saw Aztec Network (prior to closing in 2023) allow completely private DAI (an experiment
where you could have fully shielded DAI transfers using ZK on Ethereum). The Aztec team is now
building a new protocol for encrypted web3 transactions.
• Regulatory Attitude: Regulators have been wary of fully anonymous crypto (e.g., U.S. sanctioning
Tornado Cash mixer in 2022). But zkKYC flips the script – compliance-by-design. If a stablecoin can
enforce that both parties have verified credentials (all within ZK proofs), then every transaction is
compliant without exposing personal data on-chain. Early signs show openness: for instance, MAS
(Singapore) in 2023 ran Project Guardian, testing DeFi with verifiable credentials for investors –
presumably satisfied with the idea that zero-knowledge can balance transparency and privacy. The
U.S. Treasury’s 2023 risk report even mentioned ZK solutions as a possible way to mitigate illicit
finance in DeFi while preserving innovation. In practice, we might see regulated “privacy pools”:
whitelisted addresses can transact privately among themselves, but illicit addresses can’t enter the
pool (and any required disclosures can be made under court order).
• State of Tech: zk-SNARKs (zero-knowledge proofs) have advanced enough to be practical for
stablecoin-scale usage. For example, Polygon’s Nightfall project (with EY) is already doing private
ERC-20 transfers for enterprises, which could extend to stablecoins. Chainlink is working on
“Selective Disclosure” oracles, which would feed yes/no answers about identity attributes into
smart contracts without revealing the underlying data 126 . On the identity side, standards like W3C
Verifiable Credentials and DID (Decentralized ID) are maturing, enabling portable digital IDs that
can plug into zkKYC systems globally.
• Notable Quote: “Most KYC systems today demand total disclosure… Zero-knowledge proofs flip that
model,” explains the CEO of Billions Network 127 128 . This encapsulates the revolution: instead of
broadcasting who you are and what you’re doing (as current crypto does transaction-wise), you
prove only what is needed (e.g., “I’m allowed to use this USD stablecoin under my country’s law”) and
nothing more.
• Counterintuitive Finding: Privacy tech in crypto isn’t about helping criminals – it’s becoming about
protecting honest users and satisfying regulators simultaneously. This runs counter to the
narrative that crypto is an anonymity free-for-all. In fact, stablecoin issuers like Circle are actively
embracing “privacy-preserving compliance.” In Jan 2024, Circle released an internal pilot for
“Selective Disclosure” for USDC transactions, essentially allowing a user to prove to an auditor that
a particular confidential transaction did not involve blacklisted parties, without revealing the users to
the public 129 130 . So the industry trajectory suggests that in a few years, using a stablecoin could
offer more privacy than a bank transfer (no one in the middle sees your data), yet
simultaneously more assurance to regulators (via math-based compliance proofs). That’s a
remarkable reconciliation of goals that historically seemed at odds.
8. Stablecoin Failure Post-Mortems (Terra, Iron, Beanstalk, etc.)
• Terra/UST (May 2022) – $40 Billion Collapse: Terra’s UST was an algorithmic stablecoin that relied
on a sister token LUNA and trust in a 20% yield scheme. In early May 2022, a series of large
withdrawals from Terra’s Anchor protocol and liquidity pools led UST to lose its $1 peg. Within 72
hours, UST plunged to ~$0.10, wiping out ~$18B in UST market cap and about $22B in LUNA value
131 132 . Combined ~$40B vaporized – one of the largest wealth destructions in crypto 131 132 .
9Cause: a death spiral: as UST < $1, arbitrage required minting more LUNA to absorb UST – but
confidence evaporated, so LUNA’s price collapsed 99.99%, meaning UST became essentially
unbacked 133 134 . Anchor’s unsustainable 20% APY (a quasi-Ponzi incentive) had masked UST’s
fragile design 135 136 . When new funds stopped entering, the system failed exactly like a Ponzi or
bank run. Losses: investors big and small were hit; for instance, a Korean teacher’s union fund
reportedly lost $millions, and many retail in Asia were heavily invested due to Terra’s popularity.
Lessons: The Terra crash illustrated that algorithmic stablecoins without robust collateral are
inherently brittle – reliance on market psychology can’t guarantee a peg. It also had contagion: the
collapse contributed to the insolvency of hedge fund Three Arrows Capital and crypto lender Celsius,
sparking a broader crypto credit crisis. Regulators took note – South Korea indicted Terra’s founder
Do Kwon (now arrested), and US and EU regulators cited Terra’s crash as justification for stricter
stablecoin rules to prevent something of that scale in the future.
• Iron Finance (TITAN/IRON) – Mark Cuban’s Rug (June 2021): IRON was a partial-collateral
algorithmic stablecoin on Polygon – 75% collateralized by USDC, 25% by a token TITAN. In June 2021,
TITAN soared from a few dollars to ~$60, then hyperinflation to $0 in a day 137 138 . Essentially,
when some large holders started selling TITAN rewards, its price dipped, causing panic. IRON
redemptions then meant minting more TITAN, accelerating TITAN’s supply increase and price
collapse – a reflexive spiral similar to Terra’s later crash. Billionaire Mark Cuban was providing
liquidity in IRON/TITAN and got caught; he blogged “I got hit like everyone else. … Crazy part is I
got out, thought they were increasing TVL enough. Then bam.” 139 140 . Though widely called a “rug
pull,” it appears to have been a design collapse, not a malicious insider theft. Losses: relatively
smaller (TITAN’s fully diluted value was a couple billion at peak, vs Terra’s tens of billions). Cuban said
he lost maybe ~$0.87M 141 . Many DeFi farmers learned hard lessons. Lesson: Partial collateral + algo
minting can go to zero just as surely as uncollateralized. And high APYs (Iron had extremely high
yields in liquidity pools) often foreshadow unsustainable dynamics. It was a precursor to Terra, with
the crypto community largely failing to heed TITAN’s warning signs before Terra repeated the
mistake on a larger scale.
• Beanstalk (April 2022) – Governance Hack $182M: Beanstalk was an Ethereum algorithmic
stablecoin (BEAN) that maintained its peg through credit – essentially an automated central bank-ish
system. In April 2022, an attacker used a flash loan to instantly acquire a super-majority of
governance tokens and passed a proposal to send themselves all of Beanstalk’s collateral funds 142
143 . They stole ~$80M in assets (the rest of the $182M loss was BEAN value plummeting) 144 . BEAN
went from $1 to ~$0 143 . Cause: a lack of time-lock or quorum safeguards in the governance design –
“one person used a momentary loan to become 75% of the community” 145 , as one report put
it. This attack did not exploit the peg mechanism directly, but by draining reserves it destroyed
confidence in the stablecoin. Losses: about $77M remained unrecovered (the hacker laundered via
Tornado Cash). Notably, the hacker did not return funds (unlike some others). Lessons: DeFi
governance needs circuit-breakers; a stablecoin protocol is only as secure as its governance. Also,
insurance and auditing in DeFi came under focus – Beanstalk had not been fully audited for flash-
loan governance attacks. The community later rebooted Beanstalk with changes, but BEAN has not
regained popularity. For stablecoins, this highlighted an ironic point: even if your economic model is
sound, operational security can zero you out – a risk bank currencies don’t have in the same way.
• Cashio (March 2022) – “Infinite Mint” Hack to $0: Cashio Dollar (CASH) on Solana was a stablecoin
backed by liquidity pool tokens. A smart contract bug allowed an attacker to mint 2 billion CASH out
of thin air without collateral 146 147 . They redeemed about $52.8M of real assets before Cashio’s
pools were emptied 148 149 . CASH’s price promptly went to ~$0 (from $1) 150 . The hacker (oddly, a
self-proclaimed “Robin Hood”) even said they’d return funds to “small” victims 151 , though it’s
unclear if that fully happened. Cause: a coding error in account validation – “an ‘infinite mint’
10glitch” 148 . Losses: ~$40M effectively lost by yield farmers and LPs. Lessons: This was not algorithmic
instability but pure smart contract risk – highlighting that even “fully backed” stablecoins can
instantly fail if the contract has a flaw. Cashio’s team and auditors missed a critical bug; after the
hack, Cashio was abandoned (developers did not have the funds to compensate or rebuild trust).
The phrase “Cashio is not so cash yo” went around, darkly punning that stablecoins can become
worthless faster than one can say “bank run” if a smart contract integrity is compromised. It
underscored the need for rigorous audits and formal verification in stablecoin contracts.
• USDC’s Depeg (Mar 2023) – Traditional Bank Risk: Not a collapse, but a significant failure of the
peg: Following Silicon Valley Bank’s sudden failure on March 10, 2023, Circle disclosed $3.3B (8%) of
USDC’s reserves were stuck at SVB 152 153 . Fear spread over the weekend, and USDC – normally
very stable – fell to ~$0.87 on exchanges 154 153 . About $4.5B of USDC was redeemed in a few
days 155 , a modern digital bank run. By Mar 13, the Fed and FDIC guaranteed SVB deposits, Circle’s
reserves were safe, and USDC repegged to $1 156 . Cause: traditional banking fragility – Circle kept
some cash in a single mid-sized bank above insurance limits. When that bank failed, it froze those
funds. Losses: Ultimately, no one who held USDC through Monday lost money (it repegged). But
those who panic-sold at $0.90 locked in a loss, and some traders made millions arbitraging the
rebound. Lessons: Even fiat-backed stablecoins carry custodial/banking risk – a stark reminder that
stablecoin stability is only as good as the stability of the reserves and banking partners. It pushed
Circle to diversify and move more cash to BNY Mellon and the Fed’s overnight reverse repo. It also
showed the crypto market’s reflexivity: a normally rational asset can trade at a deep discount if
there’s a weekend uncertainty and no lender-of-last-resort. USDC’s depeg also caused DAI (60%
backed by USDC) to depeg to ~$0.90, illustrating stablecoin inter-dependencies. Regulators took
note that a “stable” coin can break the buck similar to a money market fund under stress, reinforcing
calls for stablecoin issuer oversight.
• Acala Dollar (aUSD) – Exploit and Freeze (Aug 2022): aUSD, a Polkadot-native overcollateralized
stablecoin, was hit by a bug when launching a liquidity pool. A misconfiguration allowed attackers to
mint 1.2 billion aUSD out of thin air 157 158 . aUSD’s price crashed ~99% to $0.01 159 . The Acala
network actually halted operations (turned to maintenance mode) and ultimately governance voted
to burn the 1.2B fraudulent aUSD and other stolen assets 160 161 . This effectively re-pegged aUSD
over time (after the burn, it went back toward $1), but confidence was shattered and Acala’s DeFi
ecosystem dried up. Cause: a code misconfiguration in a pool smart contract – not a failure of
economic design per se, but an operational/security failure. Losses: The value at risk was huge (over
$1B aUSD minted), but because the network froze, most illicit gains were reversed – however, trust in
Acala was badly damaged, and Polkadot’s credibility took a hit for having to freeze a supposedly
decentralized network. Lessons: A community intervening to save a stablecoin via rollback raises
decentralization questions – but also shows some failures can be mitigated by swift collective action
(unlike Terra where nothing could be done). It highlighted the importance of “guard rails” in code
deployments – e.g., setting cap limits on minting during early days. This event also is cited in
discussions that regulated stablecoins might be safer – Acala’s issue wouldn’t occur with something
like USDC because there’s no on-chain mint function accessible to users; only the issuer (Circle) can
create tokens and only against real reserves. So, decentralized stablecoins face a double
challenge: financial design and technical security.
• Counterintuitive Takeaways: Not all stablecoin failures stem from crypto problems – some are old-
fashioned. Terra was essentially a bank run meets Ponzi economics; Iron/TITAN was a frenzied
bubble pop; Beanstalk and Cashio were hacks/exploits; USDC’s wobble was due to real-world bank
failure. This diversity of failure modes shows that stabilizing value is hard – you have to get economic
incentives, technical security, and operational soundness all right. It’s telling that the only major USD
stablecoins that haven’t broken peg (USDT, USDC, BUSD) are fully or largely fiat-backed – but even
11they have had moments of stress (USDT dipped to $0.97 in 2018 during solvency rumors, USDC to
$0.87 as noted). Regulators now often cite these incidents in reports: “Stablecoins are stable until
they are not” – hence the push for prudential regulation akin to banks or money market funds. For
industry players, each failure provided lessons that have been woven into newer designs: more
collateral, more audits, circuit-breakers in code, etc. Arguably, the resilience of top stablecoins in
2023–25 (through various market crashes) is partly thanks to these hard-earned lessons from
spectacular failures.
9. Institutional & Enterprise Adoption
• From Experimentation to Adoption: In 2021–22, institutions were dipping toes; by 2025, many are
diving in. A 2025 Coinbase survey showed 29% of Fortune 500 executives are interested in
stablecoin use or partnerships, up from just 8% a year before 44 45 . While only ~7% have actually
integrated stablecoins to date 162 , the growth in interest is telling. 90% of surveyed institutional
finance players are exploring stablecoins for uses like instant settlement and treasury, per a 2025
Fireblocks report 163 164 . Key point: Stablecoins are no longer just a crypto-native tool; they’re seen
as a legitimate piece of financial infrastructure by corporates, fintechs, and even banks.
• Corporate Treasury & Payments: Companies with international operations use stablecoins to move
funds quickly and cheaply. E.g., Visa (Fortune 500) has piloted USDC for settling cross-border
corporate cards: by 2023 Visa expanded a pilot to settle transactions with merchants via USDC on
Ethereum and Solana, cutting out intermediaries 165 . Stripe in 2022 enabled USDC payouts to 60+
countries for gig workers (e.g. paying creators on Twitter) – and in 2023 Stripe went further by
acquiring a crypto startup (Circle’s partner) for $1B to bolster stablecoin payment capabilities 166
167 . PayPal launched its own USD stablecoin (PYUSD) in Aug 2023, marking the first major U.S.
fintech to do so 168 . PayPal sees PYUSD as the backbone for next-gen payments and transfers on its
platform (early use case: transfers between PayPal and external wallets). These moves validate
stablecoins’ role: “It’s the most significant upgrade to the dollar in decades,” PayPal’s crypto VP was
quoted in a 2024 interview (highlighting 24/7, programmability benefits).
• Banks & Financial Institutions: Banks initially shunned stablecoins, but that’s changing. In Oct
2023, BNY Mellon (America’s oldest bank) began custodying USD Coin reserves and facilitating USDC
settlement for clients, effectively integrating it with traditional banking【Circle press release】.
Goldman Sachs in 2022 did a tokenized USD transaction (though on a permissioned chain). JP
Morgan created JPM Coin (a private stablecoin for institutional use), and in 2023 disclosed it had
processed ~$300B in JPM Coin transactions for corporate clients – showing demand for instant
blockchain-based settlement. Mastercard in 2023 launched a program to help banks offer
stablecoin payments to merchants (partnering with Paxos). We also saw Visa directly invest in crypto
custody and stablecoin startups. Notably, multiple community banks and credit unions in the US
piloted USDF Consortium, effectively a group-issued bank-backed stablecoin, and while slow, it
indicates even smaller banks eye the space to avoid disintermediation. By 2025, it’s anticipated that
pending US regulation will allow banks to issue or use stablecoins more freely – potentially
unleashing a wave of bank-issued stablecoins or full integration of existing ones.
• Big Tech and Platforms: Meta (Facebook)’s Diem failed, but ironically stablecoins stepped in where
Diem left off. By 2025, WhatsApp has a pilot in certain countries (e.g. Brazil, India) enabling sending
money with stablecoins through integrations with wallets – essentially doing what Diem intended
but with third-party USDC or USDT. Telegram integrated TON stablecoins in some markets. X
(Twitter), under Elon Musk, is reportedly building payment features that could include crypto –
given Stripe’s payout integration, Twitter already indirectly touched USDC. Google and Apple have
12added support for crypto payments in their mobile wallet APIs (for instance, allowing Coinbase Card
which spends USDC). This platform adoption is nascent but in motion – if any of these flips the
switch to native stablecoin support, billions of users get exposure overnight.
• Use Cases – Beyond Remittance: Stablecoins are finding enterprise uses such as supply chain
settlements (e.g. a multinational using USDC to pay suppliers in Asia same-day rather than waiting
on wire transfers – IBM and Maersk did trials using stablecoins for instant trade settlements in
2022), and Treasury yield (some corporates park excess cash in stablecoin DeFi to earn higher yields
than bank accounts – albeit quietly, given regulatory uncertainty). Visa and Circle have highlighted
stablecoins for B2B cross-border payments as a huge area: they’re faster and ~90% cheaper than
correspondent banking for many corridors 169 170 . Even Uber’s CEO (Dara K.) said in mid-2025
they’re researching stablecoins to pay drivers globally or settle rides in different currencies more
efficiently 164 171 .
• McKinsey & a16z Data Points: A 2024 McKinsey report projected daily stablecoin transaction
volume could reach $250B by 2030, overtaking ACH and potentially rivaling card networks 172 . It
noted stablecoins as “the first true market fit for digital assets in payments” 173 . Andreessen Horowitz
(a16z) in its 2023 State of Crypto report noted stablecoins were already the payment rail of choice
in web3, and suggested if current growth continues, stablecoins might “rival the size of the credit
card industry within a decade.” This kind of bullish analysis is driving FOMO in boardrooms –
hence the significant increase in Fortune 500 interest.
• Structural Trend: “Stablecoins formed the monetary base of DeFi and are now extending into traditional
finance” 174 , as a DLNews 2025 piece put it. We see evidence: stablecoin usage by SMBs (small/med
businesses) doubled from 17% to 34% between 2024–25 in one survey 175 176 – mainly for cross-
border B2B payments and avoiding high FX fees. Visa’s CFO noted on an earnings call that a portion
of their customers’ cross-border volume in certain corridors shifted to stablecoins (likely via partner
fintechs), which Visa is “monitoring and participating in via settlement”.
• Counterintuitive Angle: Many expected large banks to resist stablecoins, but now we see them
embracing or replicating them. It turns out, stablecoins are not so much disintermediating banks as
pressuring them to innovate. Banks can actually make money with stablecoins (e.g. issuing their own
fully reserved coins and earning float revenue, just as Tether does). Additionally, stablecoins may
reduce costs for banks in back-end settlement. So the narrative has shifted: instead of “crypto vs
bank,” it’s increasingly banks and tech firms using crypto dollars to upgrade infrastructure. As a
result, the lines are blurring – when you use PayPal, Visa, Stripe in the coming years, you might be
using stablecoins under the hood without realizing. Key quote from a Visa crypto exec (2025): “We
don’t see stablecoins as competition to our network – we see them as just another network we will move
money over.” This captures that institutions now view stablecoins less as a radical threat and more as
a natural evolution in the plumbing of global finance.
10. The Last Mile – On/Off Ramps & Conversion
• Global On-Ramp Landscape: Accessing stablecoins requires fiat bridges – exchanges, fintech apps,
ATM converters, etc. By 2025, most countries have at least one crypto exchange or P2P platform
serving as an on/off-ramp, though quality varies. For instance, in Brazil, licensed exchanges
integrate with the instant payments network (PIX) – Brazilians can convert BRL to USDT in minutes,
24/7, often at tight 0.2–0.5% spreads. In Nigeria, after banks were barred (2021) from crypto, users
flocked to P2P marketplaces on Binance, Paxful, etc. They routinely swap NGN<->USDT via bank
transfer to a peer – essentially ad hoc ramps. Despite the ban, Nigeria became a top crypto market.
13(The ban was partially lifted in 2023 with plans for regulation, recognizing reality.) The upshot: even
where formal ramps lack, informal ones emerge – but with more friction and sometimes safety risks.
• MoneyGram & Co.: Traditional remittance giants are pivoting into last-mile crypto. MoneyGram now
offers cash-to-USDC and USDC-to-cash in 180+ countries through its agent network 177 178 . A
user in rural Kenya can hand cash to a MoneyGram agent and receive USDC in their Stellar wallet, or
vice versa, all in a single visit. Western Union is testing similar pilots for settling remittances via
stablecoins to local payout partners 16 17 . These integrations started around 2022 and have
expanded – effectively, MTOs (Money Transfer Operators) are turning into critical crypto off-ramps,
“leveraging their extensive payment networks as on/off-ramps” 179 . This has huge implications: it taps
into the trust and physical presence these companies have built. We’ve gone from “crypto will kill
WU” to “WU will sell you crypto” – an evolution driven by customer demand for faster/cheaper
service.
• Retail & Mobile Money Integration: In regions with large unbanked populations, tying stablecoins
into mobile money and agents is the game-changer. Kenya’s M-Pesa (66M users in Africa) is
integrating blockchain – a recent partnership will embed stablecoin infrastructure in M-Pesa across 8
countries 180 181 . Already, tech like Kotani Pay and Yellow Card allow conversion between mobile
money (M-Pesa, MTN Mobile Money) and USDT/USDC across several African nations 182 183 . This
means a user can receive USDC from abroad and directly swap to local e-money on their phone. In
the Philippines, GCash (mobile wallet with 66M users) partnered with Stellar and MoneyGram to
enable USDC cash-outs at pawnshop agents 184 185 . Latin America: countries like Argentina –
numerous crypto ATMs let people buy USDT for cash (as inflation hedge), and fintech apps like Belo
connect stablecoins to local bank transfers. Notably, in Brazil, a startup SmartPay integrated Tether
(USDT) with 24,000 ATMs via TecBan network 186 . Starting Nov 2022, Brazilians can go to regular
ATMs and convert BRL <-> USDT 186 . That’s a huge last-mile leap: stablecoins available from your
corner ATM, no bank needed.
• Legal Barriers & Receptiveness: Some countries still ban or heavily restrict crypto on-ramps. China
is the big one – direct trading is illegal; people use OTC desks and Tether P2P informally. India has
no ban but imposed a crippling 1% transaction tax that gutted exchange volumes by ~90%. This
drove many to offshore platforms or underground trading – indicating draconian measures mostly
shift activity, not stop it. Russia in 2022 banned crypto payments but has considered using
stablecoins for international trade to bypass sanctions (an experiment with stablecoin settlement
with friendly countries is reportedly in discussion). In Western nations, on-ramps are plenty
(Coinbase, etc.), but regulations (KYC/AML) add friction – e.g., in the US, linking a bank, waiting days
for ACH clearance, etc. That’s why fintechs like MoonPay and Ramp emerged to allow instant card
purchases of stablecoins (with fees ~3.5%, pricey but instant). EU’s MiCA law (2024) will make it
easier for licensed entities to offer services across Europe, likely expanding quality on-ramps in
smaller EU states by passporting a license.
• On-Ramp Quality Metrics: Two metrics matter – cost and accessibility. In places like Turkey, on-
ramps are numerous (several local exchanges), competition kept fees low (~0.2% trading fees) –
result: Turkey leads MENA in stablecoin use. In contrast, Pakistan (where crypto is gray-area) sees
people pay premiums up to 5% to buy USDT via Hawala brokers, and accessibility is limited to those
in urban centers. That gap shows how regulatory openness correlates with user cost. It’s noteworthy
that over 30 countries in 2023 had inflation >10%, and in many of those (Argentina, Lebanon,
Nigeria, Zimbabwe), demand for stablecoins is high but formal on-ramps are limited or banks
hostile. So citizens have innovated: e.g., Argentines commonly use P2P stablecoin trades for USD
access, and Lebanese WhatsApp groups run daily USDT auctions as the informal FX market.
• ATMs and Physical Agents: By 2025 there are over 50,000 crypto ATMs worldwide, most in the US,
but increasingly in Latin America and Asia 187 . Many now support stablecoins (not just Bitcoin). Their
14fees can be high (5-10%), but they provide a familiar interface for those without exchange accounts.
Also, convenience stores and postal outlets in some countries have begun offering crypto
purchase services – in 2022, Japan’s postal bank experimented with stablecoin remittances, and
in 2023, 7-Eleven Philippines launched a service to convert cash to crypto via ECPay (including
USDC). This “stablecoin at your local store” trend is nascent but logical.
• Legal Integrations: A few countries are integrating stablecoin off-ramps into financial
infrastructure. El Salvador uses Strike app (Bitcoin and USDT) nationwide – effectively using Tether
as part of its remittance infrastructure. UAE free zones in 2023 allowed licensed firms to accept
stablecoins for payments (e.g., a Dubai real estate developer sold properties for USDC). This blurs
the line between off-ramp and direct acceptance – if merchants take stablecoins, the “last mile” is
solved because you may not need to convert to local fiat at all.
• Counterintuitive Insight: The hardest part of the crypto revolution isn’t the crypto – it’s connecting
it to real economies. Stablecoin providers learned they needed the old networks (banking agents,
ATMs, remittance shops) to reach users outside crypto hubs. That’s why we see deals like Tether +
MoneyGram, Stellar + Western Union. Rather than destroy the incumbents, stablecoins are
enlisting them. This runs contrary to early crypto rhetoric of complete disintermediation. Instead, in
many locales, your path to stablecoins might be through a very traditional channel – and that’s
okay if it lowers cost and increases access. Over time, as more salaries, bills, and goods can be paid
directly in stablecoins, these ramps will get more seamless. For now, though, “cash to crypto”
bridges are crucial. Countries that facilitate them (through sensible regulation) are seeing adoption
flourish in a safer manner, whereas those that ban or ignore them see users go underground or face
higher costs. One striking example: Zimbabwe’s government, facing hyperinflation, launched a
gold-backed digital token in 2023 to compete with the informal dollar stablecoin use –
effectively acknowledging that people want stable value and will get it one way or another. It’s a last-
mile lesson: if the formal economy doesn’t provide a conduit to stability, people will route around –
and stablecoins are often the vehicle of choice.
11. Historical Parallels to Stablecoin Adoption
• Eurodollars (1960s onward): Perhaps the closest analog. Eurodollars were USD deposits held
outside the U.S. banking system (London, etc.), beyond direct U.S. regulation. They grew explosively
as they met a market need (offshore dollar liquidity) – much like stablecoins (crypto-dollars) grew to
meet demand for digital dollars outside traditional banks. The U.S. initially viewed Eurodollars with
suspicion, worrying about monetary control loss, similar to today’s officials eyeing stablecoins 66
67 . Over time, Eurodollars became integral to global finance, even though they existed in a
regulatory gray zone. Parallel: Stablecoins = “Eurodollars on blockchain.” Both started as bank
liabilities outside home regulation; both extend dollar reach. In the 1970s, Eurodollars helped
cement USD dominance – we see stablecoins doing the same in the 2020s (as noted, >90% of volume
USD 188 29 ). One difference: Eurodollars were largely used by institutions, whereas stablecoins
began retail-driven (though now institutions are heavily involved). Key lesson: The U.S. eventually
tacitly supported Eurodollar markets (they provided flexibility during Bretton Woods collapse). We
may similarly see stablecoins move from being edgy “shadow” dollars to officially integrated dollars.
In effect, stablecoins could be the Eurodollars of the 21st century, and regulatory efforts (like the
draft U.S. stablecoin laws) aim to bring them into the fold rather than eliminate them.
• Credit Cards (1950s–70s adoption): Early charge cards (Diners Club, 1950) and bank credit cards
(BankAmericard, 1958) took ~20–30 years to achieve ubiquity. They faced chicken-and-egg
problems (few merchants accept -> few consumers carry, and vice versa) and had to overcome fraud
15and technical issues (card imprint machines, etc.). To scale, banks formed consortia (Visa,
MasterCard) in late 60s, agreeing on standards and sharing risk 189 190 . Parallel: Stablecoins today
have network effect issues (acceptance vs usage) – e.g., it’s not useful to pay your grocery in USDC if
they can’t accept it. We might see consortia or industry alliances akin to Visa’s origin. Indeed, there
are talks of bank-led stablecoins networks (the USDF consortium of banks, or potentially a unified
“Fed stablecoin”). In credit cards, regulation was light early on, enabling experimentation but also big
failures (fraud waves in 60s). Stablecoins similarly had a wild-west period (Terra, etc.). Eventually,
credit cards got uniform rules (Regulation Z, etc.) and consumer protections, which boosted trust.
We’re now at that stage for stablecoins – crafting rules so that mainstream users and institutions feel
safe adopting them, just as consistent rules helped credit cards go mainstream. Another credit card
parallel: rewards & loyalty. In the 80s, credit cards exploded when reward programs (miles, cash-back)
gave extra reason to use them. We may see stablecoins piggyback on similar incentives (already
some fintechs offer yield or rewards for transacting in stablecoins). The timeframe could compress
(stablecoins might achieve broad adoption in 10–15 years from inception, vs 30 for cards) due to the
internet’s faster network effects.
• Container Shipping (1950s–60s): As referenced by an AIER piece, the standard shipping container
(1956) revolutionized global trade by standardization 191 192 . Before containers, shipping was
labor-intensive, slow, expensive – analogous to today’s cross-border payments. The container
provided a universal format that every port, ship, truck could handle. Analogy: Stablecoins can be
the “containers” for money 192 . Instead of each country’s banking system being a different format,
stablecoins (especially if regulated and interoperable) could be a universal digital value unit that
moves seamlessly across platforms and borders. The AIER article even equates recent U.S. stablecoin
legislation to agreeing on container size standards 193 . Insight: The container didn’t replace ships or
trade goods – it just made the process efficient. Likewise, stablecoins don’t replace the dollar – they
“standardize its transport” 194 195 . The impact of containers was huge: 8x increase in trade over a
few decades 196 . If stablecoins achieve container-like universality (say via international regulatory
agreements and adoption), one could see a similar boom in economic activity by slashing the friction
in moving money.
• Mobile Money (2000s): M-Pesa in Kenya (launched 2007) is a strong parallel in terms of use case
and adoption curve. M-Pesa turned mobile airtime credits into a de facto digital currency for the
unbanked, going from 0 to 50%+ of the adult population in about 5 years. Stablecoins are doing
something similar globally – turning a ubiquitous tool (a smartphone + internet) into a bank in your
hand with dollars. In Kenya, M-Pesa’s rapid uptake was driven by a collapse of trust in banks and
need for remittances – similar to how Argentine or Nigerian citizens flock to USDT when their
currency or banks fail them. Now, stablecoins are essentially “mobile money 2.0 – global edition.”
Interestingly, M-Pesa is now planning to incorporate stablecoins for cross-border, essentially merging
the two eras 181 . Another analogy: interoperability. In early mobile money, each provider was siloed
(couldn’t send from M-Pesa to say, MTN’s MobileMoney in Ghana). Over time, regulators pushed
interoperability and also connected mobile money to banks. We see a push now to connect
stablecoins to each other and to banking systems (via APIs, etc.). So history suggests that forcing
interoperability (common standards) earlier rather than later can accelerate network effects.
• Internet Adoption (1990s): The Internet’s spread had an S-curve – long tail of slow start (70s–80s
research, early 90s ~0.5% of world on internet) then explosive growth late 90s through 2000s to
>50%. Stablecoins started around 2014 (Tether), really took off 2018–21, and now perhaps ~10% of
crypto users globally have used them (tens of millions of people). Could they follow an internet-like
trajectory? Possibly: if regulatory green lights are given, stablecoins could jump from niche to
mainstream in a decade. The internet’s tipping point was arguably when it became easier to use
(web browsers, AOL CDs, etc.) and when key content/services were available. For stablecoins, ease of
16use is improving (user-friendly fintech apps abstract blockchain complexity). The “content” equivalent
is real-world acceptance – once you can pay major merchants or receive salary in stablecoins easily,
adoption can snowball. A cautionary parallel: the diffusion of new financial tech can be slower if
trust is lacking. For example, contactless card payments were technologically ready by late 1990s,
but took until the 2010s to truly proliferate because of trust and habit – people were used to swiping
or cash. Stablecoins might face similar inertia outside early adopters. But younger generations
comfortable with digital wallets could leapfrog. Also, crises can accelerate adoption – just as COVID
accelerated contactless and digital banking usage. Similarly, an inflation crisis or banking crisis can
accelerate stablecoin uptake (as seen in Lebanon 2021–22).
• Others (Euro currency unification, etc.): The introduction of the Euro (1999–2002) might have
some instructive points: multiple currencies were merged, requiring huge coordination, public
adaptation, and trust-building in a new unit. Stablecoins in a way create a unified “internet dollar”
that people globally adopt even if not their national currency. Like the euro, there’s pushback from
those losing autonomy (national central banks then, emerging market central banks now with
stablecoins). The Euro succeeded because it had strong governance and backing. Stablecoins may
need an equivalent (clear reserves, issuer accountability) to gain universal trust.
• Counterintuitive Perspective: Far from being unprecedented, stablecoin adoption has many
historical echoes – it’s more evolution than revolution. This suggests two things: (1) We can predict
hurdles (e.g., need for standards – as with containers; need for consortium/co-opetition – as with
credit cards; need for trust frameworks – as with Eurodollars). (2) We see inevitability – if
stablecoins solve real problems (like containers and internet did), they will likely overcome obstacles
and become part of the fabric of commerce. Perhaps the most striking analogy came from that AIER
article: “Stablecoins are the shipping containers of monetary influence. If we define the standard, the
world will adopt it. If we hesitate, others will fill the vacuum.” 65 . In historical terms: the technology
that reduces friction and builds network effects tends to win – and stablecoins, by aligning with the
entrenched dominance of the dollar and leveraging blockchain efficiency, appear on that path,
assuming we manage the risks.
12. Energy & Environmental Considerations
• Blockchain Energy Post-Merge: The narrative of “crypto = energy hog” has flipped for stablecoins
because most run on proof-of-stake or similar chains. Ethereum’s Merge (Sept 2022) reduced its
power usage by ~99.9% 197 . Ethereum went from ~23 million MWh/year (comparable to a mid-size
country) to just ~2,600 MWh/year 198 . That’s like going from the consumption of 2-3 million U.S.
homes to that of ~200 homes 198 . With Ethereum’s carbon footprint negligible (CO2 output down
99.99% 198 ), the major stablecoins on Ethereum (USDC, USDT Ethereum) became extremely low-
impact per transaction overnight. To quantify: a single ETH transaction now uses on the order of 0.03
kWh (rough estimate) versus ~200 kWh pre-Merge – that’s more than a 6,000× improvement 197
199 . Solana and Tron, popular stablecoin networks, were already low-energy. Solana Foundation
reported in 2022 that a Solana transaction used 0.00051 kWh (≈ one Google search energy) and the
whole network about 3,186 MWh/year – roughly equal to 350 U.S. homes’ usage【Solana Energy
Report 2022】. Tron is DPoS with ~50 validators and has energy needs akin to running a few data
centers; exact numbers aren’t published, but given Tron’s $13M daily fee revenue by mid-2025 200
201 , and assuming those fees mainly cover infrastructure, it suggests modest electricity
consumption (likely <0.1% of Bitcoin’s, for instance).
• Vs. Traditional Payments: Visa has famously stated its network’s energy per transaction is
minuscule – Visa estimates ~0.0002 kWh per card transaction. The entire Visa global network uses
17maybe 100s of thousands of kWh per day (mostly data centers). Now, stablecoin networks are in a
similar ballpark. For instance, 100,000 USDC transfers on Solana might consume ~50 kWh total –
comparable to Visa’s footprint for that many swipes, if not less. Thus, stablecoins on PoS likely have
no greater carbon footprint per txn than existing digital payments (and in some cases, might
piggyback on renewable-powered networks – e.g. Solana and Cardano claim carbon neutrality).
Banking system energy: This is harder to gauge, but consider all bank branch offices (with lights,
AC), ATM machines (2M+ globally), server farms for banks, paper logistics, etc. One study by
Greenpeace in 2022 argued that the traditional banking sector’s energy consumption is twice that
of Bitcoin – though that was disputed. However, it stands to reason that fully digital stablecoin
systems, especially if running on efficient blockchains, could be leaner than maintaining thousands
of physical branches and mainframes for clearance.
• Post-Merge Example: After Ethereum’s Merge, one researcher noted that the energy saved annually
(~99.95% reduction) was equivalent to taking the entire country of Austria* off-grid in terms of
CO2 emissions 198 202 . So Ethereum-based stablecoins (like DAI, USDC) went from “each tx =
powering a U.S. house for a day” to “each tx = boiling a cup of tea.” This removed a major ESG
objection to stablecoins for institutions. In fact, *2023 saw more corporates comfortable using
Ethereum stablecoins specifically because the ESG issue was mitigated. Contrast this with
Bitcoin: a BTC transaction still uses ~1,150 kWh (though that secures much value, it’s huge per
payment) – but stablecoins generally avoid Bitcoin’s network for transactions.
• Tron’s Energy Quirk: Tron’s proof-of-stake (actually delegated proof-of-authority hybrid) means
energy use scales very little with volume (just keep validators running). However, Tron’s TRX token
price spiked in 2025, raising the cost of transactions (in TRX) and ironically increasing energy if
validators increased hardware – Tron addressed this by slashing fees 60% in Aug 2025 203 8 . This
kept USDT-Tron cheap and presumably energy-efficient per txn. Tron claims 75% of its transactions
are “gasless” (subsidized) by design to encourage adoption 204 , and it generates about $2M daily in
fees currently 205 which implies energy costs likely far less than $2M worth of electricity (since much
of that is profit to validators).
• Renewables & Emissions: Many PoS chains have validator nodes run on cloud servers which
increasingly use renewable energy or purchase carbon offsets. E.g., Polygon achieved carbon-
neutral status mid-2022 by offsetting emissions. Stellar has been carbon-neutral since 2020 by low
usage and offsets. For corporate ESG reports, using a stablecoin on these networks could be
reported as near-zero emissions. In contrast, using physical cash has hidden footprints (minting
coins, printing notes, transporting them). There have been attempts to quantify that: the ECB
estimated the carbon footprint of cash circulation in Eurozone (2018) was ~7.4 million tons CO2 (not
trivial). While not directly comparable, it indicates digital can be greener.
• DeFi vs TradFi Energy Intensity: A quirky observation: in 2021, at peak, Ethereum DeFi’s energy per
transaction was astronomical due to PoW. By 2025, DeFi (powered by stablecoins) likely uses far
less energy per $ settled than traditional finance’s settlement layers. For instance, Fedwire (the
U.S. interbank system) processes ~$5T/day with some hundreds of computers – very efficient per
dollar. But stablecoins like USDC now move ~$15B/day and growing 206 , and do so on efficient
chains, arguably matching or beating the legacy in energy per dollar terms. It’s hard to precisely
compare (banks have overhead beyond payments), but the trend is clear: with PoS, crypto’s energy
use scales sub-linearly with volume, making it potentially more efficient as load increases.
• Counterintuitive Angle: The environmental criticism of crypto mostly hinged on Bitcoin’s mining.
But stablecoins largely avoid Proof-of-Work, so much so that some have noted transacting $1M via
USDC likely uses less energy than transacting $1M via the banking system. Why? Because the banking
system might involve multiple data centers, intermediaries and sometimes even physical paper (e.g.,
correspondent banks reconciling). Meanwhile, a Solana or Polygon can move that $1M in one shot
18with a single cryptographic validation. We’re not fully there yet with every chain or scenario, but it’s
conceivable the greenest way to send money across the world could soon be via a stablecoin,
contrary to the old belief that crypto is wasteful. In sum, energy is becoming a selling point for
stablecoins, not a drawback, especially as networks continue to incorporate renewable energy and
as Ethereum (with major stablecoin usage) likely moves to even more efficient sharded designs. The
big remaining environmental question might be e-waste from hardware if usage skyrockets, but
that’s minor compared to the prior PoW carbon issue. So, while stablecoins revolutionize finance,
they might also quietly help reduce the carbon footprint of moving money by simplifying
infrastructure – an outcome few outside the industry anticipated a few years ago.
13. The Interoperability Problem (Bridges, Hacks, and Solutions)
• The “Blockchain Balkanization”: Stablecoin liquidity is fragmented across many chains – Ethereum,
Tron, BSC, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, etc. Users often need to bridge stablecoins from one chain to
another to use different applications. Traditionally, this meant using cross-chain bridges: protocols
that lock coin on Chain A and mint a “wrapped” version on Chain B. Problem: Bridges have been
high-value honeypots and notoriously insecure. About $2.5 billion has been stolen in bridge
hacks** from 2021–2023 207 208 – including some of the largest DeFi hacks ever.
• Notorious Bridge Hacks: In February 2022, the Wormhole bridge (Ethereum <-> Solana) was
exploited for 120,000 ETH (~$325M) 209 113 – the attacker found a bug in Wormhole’s signature
verification, minted wrapped ETH on Solana without locking real ETH, then cashed out. Jump Trading
had to step in and replace the funds to keep Wormhole solvent 210 211 . Similarly, the Nomad
bridge (Ethereum <-> others) had a code bug leading to a chaotic $190M theft in Aug 2022
(hundreds of copycat attackers drained it). Poly Network lost ~$611M in 2021 through a cross-chain
flaw (that hacker returned the funds) 212 213 . These incidents underscore that bridges are often
the weakest link, sometimes relying on a small multisig or poorly audited code. Decentralization
issue: many current bridges are semi-trusted (a few nodes sign off on transfers). This creates both
security and censorship concerns (e.g., an OFAC sanction on a bridge could freeze cross-chain
assets).
• User Friction & Risk: For users, bridging stablecoins is a pain point. One has to pick the right bridge
(each with different fees and times), risk of failure (several minor bridges paused operations after
hacks, stranding funds). There’s also UX confusion: often users end up with multiple “flavors” of
USDC (e.g., “USDC.e” on Avalanche vs native “USDC”). If they send the wrong kind to an exchange, it
might not be recognized – causing lost funds or manual recovery. This is akin to the early internet
having separate networks that didn’t talk. It’s said that bridging is currently “where user funds go to
die” – a dark joke referencing how many people have lost money sending stablecoins via the wrong
network or to bad bridges.
• Emerging Solutions – Native Cross-Chain Transfers: Recognizing this, stablecoin issuers and
developers have devised alternatives. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) launched in
2023 allows USDC to move from one chain to another by burning on source and minting on
destination 214 . No liquidity pools or wrapping – Circle itself facilitates redemption and issuance in
a single flow. CCTP currently connects Ethereum <-> Avalanche, with more to come 214 215 . By late
2025, usage grew – in one month, CCTP moved $7.7B USDC cross-chain 216 , showing demand for a
safer alternative to bridges. Other stablecoins may implement similar burn/mint portals (though it
requires the issuer’s direct involvement).
• Interoperability Protocols: Projects like Chainlink CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol)
and LayerZero aim to provide standardized messaging between chains. In July 2023, SWIFT
19announced experiments with Chainlink CCIP to instruct token transfers across multiple chains
(imagine SWIFT sending a message that moves stablecoin from a bank’s address on Ethereum to one
on Polygon – all via CCIP). LayerZero enabled the concept of omnichain tokens, where a single
token contract spans chains. Stargate bridge (LayerZero’s stablecoin bridge) has been used by Circle
for CCTP messaging. These solutions try to ensure security via multiple oracles and relayers
agreeing on messages (CCIP uses decentralized oracles, LayerZero uses an oracle+relayer design).
No major hacks of these new-gen protocols have occurred so far, but they’re relatively young.
• Bridgeless Multi-Chain Stablecoins: Tether has taken a simpler route for USDT: rather than
bridging, they separately issue USDT on ~14 chains. There’s no direct convertibility (you rely on third
parties to swap chain versions), but it avoids some risk – if one chain’s USDT is compromised (hasn’t
happened yet), others remain unaffected. However, this puts the onus on exchanges or users to do
off-chain swaps to move USDT across networks (often via a centralized exchange).
• User-Level Solutions: Aggregators like LI.FI or Socket have emerged – these find the best route to
bridge assets (including stablecoins) and abstract some complexity for the user. Also, centralized
exchanges (CEXs) ironically serve as a popular “bridge”: users withdraw stablecoins on whatever
chain they want by depositing to an exchange and withdrawing on the target chain (exchanges
internally manage liquidity). This is fairly safe but re-centralizes the process.
• Decentralization vs. Practicality: Purists want trustless bridges, but truly trust-minimized interop
(like a fully decentralized light-client relay between chains) is hard and often expensive. Hence most
interim solutions have some trust assumptions or involvement of issuers. The industry seems to be
converging on a “hub and spoke” model where a few major protocols (CCTP, CCIP) serve as
neutral highways for cross-chain transfers, rather than dozens of independent bridges. This is
reminiscent of how in the early internet there were many networks, but eventually common
protocols (TCP/IP) connected everything. We’re in the “many networks, imperfect gateways” phase
for blockchains.
• Bridge Hacks Impact on Perception: The string of bridge hacks in 2021–22 did slow institutional
comfort with DeFi to a degree. Seeing hundreds of millions stolen in essentially “payment pipeline”
infrastructure was a red flag. That’s partly why companies like Circle stepped in to provide a safer
mechanism (CCTP). Regulators too are concerned – EU’s MiCA mandates that significant
stablecoins must have a robust custody/trust mechanism if operating on multiple chains,
implicitly discouraging unaccountable bridges. In the US, recent Treasury reports called cross-chain
activity a leading “illicit finance concern” because stolen funds often hop chains via bridges 207
217 . This is pushing development of compliance-friendly bridges and “travel rule” integration on
them (so identity info can move with funds across chains).
• Counterintuitive Point: The quest for decentralization ironically created new central points of
failure – bridges. The response now is a slight recentralization or standardization to mitigate that
(with issuers and large protocols playing a bigger role). In a way, it’s history rhyming: disparate
private bank notes in the 1800s had to be standardized via clearinghouses; similarly, disparate chain
tokens are finding clearing mechanisms. The difference: all moves faster in crypto time. We went
from ignoring interoperability to multiple solutions in about 2 years post-DeFi boom. The likely end
state is that users won’t even know a bridge is used – just like sending an email, you don’t know the
route it takes. Achieving that invisibility is the goal of efforts like CCIP. Until then, the user
experience remains a bit “1990s internet” – one wrong move and your money’s in limbo.
Closing that gap is critical for stablecoins to be truly mainstream (a normal user can’t be expected to
navigate bridge risks). The encouraging news: the biggest players (Circle, Chainlink, even SWIFT) are
actively working on it, so the patchwork of wrapped coins and risky bridges might, in a few years, be
as forgotten as dial-up modems – an artifact of the early days we’re happy to leave behind.
2014. DeFi and Stablecoin-Based Financial Infrastructure
• DeFi’s “Money Markets” Run on Stablecoins: In decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins are the
lifeblood – providing the unit of account and most of the liquidity. As of late 2025, roughly 50–60%
of all value locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols is in stablecoins or stablecoin-derived assets (e.g., LP
tokens of stablecoin pools) 174 218 . Total DeFi TVL across chains stands around $230B (Q3 2025
record) 219 220 , recovering from a dip after 2022. Ethereum still dominates (near $100B TVL by
itself) 206 221 . Within that:
• Lending protocols (Aave, Compound, Maker): They collectively hold tens of billions – e.g.,
MakerDAO has ~$8B deposits creating DAI; Aave V3 markets ~ $15B liquidity. Stablecoins make up
the majority of borrowed assets (people borrow USDC/USDT/DAI more than volatile coins) and also
much of the collateral. In Maker, over 40% of collateral is actually USDC (parked as reserves via the
Peg Stability Module) – showing stablecoins collateralizing other stablecoins! DeFi daily lending
volumes are in the low billions (Aave might do a few hundred million in loan issuance daily,
Compound similar) – small compared to TradFi, but significant growth. For perspective, the U.S. repo
market is ~$4T daily; DeFi lending maybe $5B daily issuance and ~$70B outstanding 222 . So ~1% the
size – small, but existent.
• DEXs (Uniswap, Curve, PancakeSwap): Stablecoin pairs are the highest-volume pairs. Curve,
focusing on stable-to-stable swaps, has about $20B TVL mostly in pools of USDT, USDC, DAI, etc.,
and processes $100–200M in daily volume. Uniswap uses USDC or DAI as one side of most pools – it
effectively acts as the decentralized FX market where stablecoins trade vs ETH, etc. Uniswap’s volume
often rivals Coinbase’s; in 2025 it’s doing ~$1B/day, with stablecoins facilitating much of that.
• Derivatives and Structured Products: Protocols like dYdX, GMX, etc., use stablecoins as collateral/
margin. Daily crypto futures volume on decentralized venues is still modest (~$2–5B) vs centralized
($100B+), but growing. Stablecoins enable anyone to be a market maker or lender – the combined daily
decentralized stablecoin lending volume (~$1–2B) is small next to Fed daily operations, but it’s a seed
of a parallel system.
• Stablecoins as “Reserve Currency” of DeFi: An IMF working paper (2022) described stablecoins as
the “reserve currency of crypto-ecosystem”, analogous to how USD is reserve currency of global
finance 174 . This is evident: when traders exit positions, they go into USDC/USDT (rather than local
fiat). DeFi protocols often keep treasury in stablecoins. Even hacks – hackers steal ETH then usually
swap to stablecoins. So stablecoins function as the crypto-dollar internally. Notably, stablecoins
have even begun to underlie algorithmic credit creation in DeFi: e.g., protocols like Abracadabra took
interest-bearing stablecoin deposits and let people borrow more stablecoins against them
(“degenbox” – which partly led to Terra’s cascade). This rehypothecation and yield-chasing shows a
nascent shadow banking forming on stablecoins, with parallel risks. In 2022, MakerDAO initiated
“real world asset” vaults, investing $1B+ of its DAI reserves into U.S. Treasury bills via a partnership –
effectively becoming a money market fund that takes stablecoins (DAI) and invests in TradFi
instruments (T-bills) 223 . DeFi is thus reaching out to TradFi, using stablecoins as the bridge
currency.
• TradFi Money Markets vs DeFi: Traditional U.S. money market funds hold ~$5.5 trillion of assets
(short-term gov and corporate debt). DeFi’s closest analog – lending protocols + DEX stable pools –
might sum to ~0.05% of that. So, on one hand, DeFi is tiny. On the other, growth rates for DeFi (even
after a bear market) outpace TradFi growth. Also, DeFi is global by default and 24/7. For an individual
or small business in a country with weak banking, parking value in a stablecoin and maybe earning
3–8% in a DeFi yield farm is hugely attractive relative to local banks (if accessible safely). This is
occurring (anecdotally, SMEs in Asia and Africa using USDC on Compound via fintech fronts). A16z
21has pointed out that stablecoin DeFi yields act as a “global reference rate for dollars accessible to
anyone,” somewhat like LIBOR was globally【a16z report 2023】. It sounds lofty, but indeed many
decentralized dollar lending markets ended up clustering yields around the Fed rate plus some risk
premium.
• Financial Infrastructure Integration: Visa in 2023 publicized how they could use a smart contract
to automatically sweep USDC from Ethereum to their treasury on a schedule – effectively using DeFi
(via an auto swap contract) for treasury ops 165 . Also, Stripe’s USDC payout flows are an enterprise
use of stablecoin infrastructure that bypasses SWIFT/Western Union entirely for recipients. PayPal’s
PYUSD runs on Ethereum and can plug into DeFi easily (though PayPal can freeze transfers).
Mastercard is partnering with public blockchains (Polygon in 2023 for an artist payments project) to
leverage stablecoins for settlements. These show stablecoin-based rails melding into corporate
processes – not outright replacing legacy, but augmenting where they offer speed/cost benefits.
• Decentralization vs Regulation: As stablecoins become financial infrastructure, regulators worry
DeFi could replicate systemic risks. FSB (Financial Stability Board) in 2023 noted that significant
stablecoin-DeFi linkages (like large pools or lending) could, in a crisis, have contagion effects (e.g., a
USDC depeg causing a cascade of DeFi liquidations). Yet currently the scale is such that even Terra’s
collapse ($40B) didn’t roil traditional markets (though it contributed to crypto hedge fund failures). If
stablecoins reached, say, $1T cap and DeFi $500B TVL, a shock could have macro relevance.
Regulators thus are considering bringing certain DeFi activities under oversight if run by
identifiable entities – but truly decentralized ones pose a challenge.
• TradFi Comparison – Daily Volume: FedWire (wholesale transfers) moves ~$3–5T per day. ACH (US
retail transfers) moves about $200B/day. By contrast, stablecoins transfer ~$12–20B on-chain per day
(excl. internal CEX transfers). It’s smaller, but within an order of magnitude of ACH and growing. And
stablecoins settle nearly instantly vs ACH’s 2–3 day cycles. This perhaps explains why FedNow
launched – the Fed indirectly admits the need for real-time retail payments to compete with crypto’s
speed.
• Counterintuitive Observation: Stablecoins and DeFi are often called “shadow banking”, implying
risky and unregulated. But one can argue parts of DeFi are more transparent and over-collateralized
than traditional banking. For example, Compound’s open ledger lets anyone assess reserves in real-
time (no fractional lending; collateral ratios enforced). In 2022, MakerDAO navigated the crash with
zero bailouts – its over-collateralized model handled even a 70% crypto price drop, and DAI only
briefly wobbled then regained peg. In contrast, some TradFi money market funds needed Fed
backstops in 2020. This suggests a hybrid future: maybe TradFi money markets adopt some DeFi
traits (on-chain accounting, instant settlement) while DeFi is adopting TradFi traits (real-world
assets, regulatory compliance modules). Stablecoins sit in the middle, literally the base money of
DeFi and the bridge to fiat. We see evidence by late 2025: Wall Street firms (e.g. Franklin
Templeton) launched tokenized money market funds on-chain, accessible via stablecoins, blurring
lines. The core narrative: stablecoins have bootstrapped a parallel financial system in under 5 years.
It’s small, but it’s functional and global. As one 2025 Galaxy Research piece noted, “crypto-
collateralized lending hit an ATH of $73.6B [Q3 2025]” 222 , meaning the crypto banking system is
quietly regrowing after 2022’s washout. If regulatory clarity and more on-ramps come, stablecoin-
based finance could scale exponentially – akin to how eurocurrency markets exploded in the 1970s
once they gained credibility. But prudent design and oversight will be key to avoid repeating 2008 in
this new realm. For now, stablecoin infrastructure in DeFi has proven relatively robust (no stablecoin
bank runs in 2023 despite broader crypto stress), giving some confidence that with appropriate
safeguards, this new financial layer can complement the old rather than just wildly disrupt it.
2215. Timeline and Milestones Ahead
• 2024–2025 – Regulatory Frameworks & Legitimization: These two years are pivotal. Mid-2024, the
EU’s MiCA law comes into effect, requiring stablecoin issuers to be licensed and capped (e.g., non-
euro stablecoin trading volume in EU can’t exceed 1M tx/day without extra oversight). This will
formalize Euro markets – expect some smaller EU banks or fintechs to launch euro-backed
stablecoins under MiCA, and Tether/Circle to get EU licenses or pull back if they don’t. In the U.S.,
late 2024 or 2025 is likely when a federal Stablecoin Act passes (with bipartisan support coalescing
around reserving oversight to Fed for non-bank issuers) 193 . If that happens, by 2025 H2, we could
see the first FDIC-insured stablecoin issuers or non-banks getting Federal Reserve accounts (the
draft GENIUS Act allowed this) 193 224 . That would be a watershed: stablecoins openly integrated in
the U.S. banking system.
• Market Cap & Usage Growth: If regulation opens doors, major fintechs and banks will more freely
use stablecoins. Projections: Bloomberg Intelligence (2023) estimated stablecoin supply could reach
$2.8 trillion by 2030, assuming 30% annual growth and some displacement of bank deposits 225 .
That might be optimistic, but even a more conservative uptake (say $500B by 2030) is significant.
Payment volume is expected to grow faster than supply as velocity increases (just like M2 money
turnover). BI projected $56 trillion stablecoin transaction volume by 2030 225 226 , which is
roughly 2x Visa+MC’s 2022 volume. If realized, stablecoins would truly be a mainstream payment rail.
Some tipping points to watch: Stablecoin daily volume > SWIFT volume (SWIFT moves ~$5–6T/day).
At current growth rates, that might happen by late 2020s.
• CBDC Launches vs. Stablecoins: 2025–2026 will see big CBDC moves – the EU likely decides on
digital euro issuance by 2026; China aims to expand e-CNY use in Belt & Road countries by 2025; the
U.S. Fed will either launch a pilot CBDC or continue researching slowly. This timeline matters for
stablecoins: a widely available Fed CBDC could either compete with or complement private
stablecoins. If the Fed goes slow (which looks likely), stablecoins have a longer runway as the only
game in town for digital dollars. Many analysts think the Fed will in the end rely on private sector for
retail stablecoins and focus on wholesale (interbank) CBDC if any. By 2027, if banks are issuing their
own stablecoins or using a Fed token, the landscape might shift from today’s crypto-native issuers
(Tether, Circle) to more institution-issued tokens.
• Technical Maturity: By 2025, Ethereum will likely introduce proto-danksharding (blobs for cheap
data) – lowering Layer1 fees significantly. Layer2 adoption (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync) will be
mainstream, making stablecoin transactions pennies or less with similar security. Also, cross-chain
standards (CCIP, CCTP) will be widely implemented – by 2026, the average user may not know or care
what chain their stablecoin is on; their wallet will handle routing (much like your phone picks WiFi vs
4G automatically). This seamlessness will be a turning point for user experience. Additionally, privacy
layers (see Section 7) may be integrated by then – so by 2026–27, using a stablecoin might feel like
using a bank app in terms of privacy and ease, but with crypto’s speed and global reach.
• Adoption Milestones: A few specific milestones to watch for that would signal a new level of
adoption: A G7 country’s central bank or sovereign fund holding stablecoins (even just as test) –
none publicly do yet, but smaller central banks (e.g., in Asia or Africa) might in late 2020s to facilitate
FX reserves or remittances. Major merchants accepting stablecoins natively: if an Amazon,
Walmart, or Alibaba starts taking USDC for payments (even if via a third-party processor), that would
be huge – could happen by 2025–26 if regulatory clarity and demand align (Stripe or PayPal could
enable this behind scenes). Salaries paid in stablecoins: Already common in crypto industry, but if
by 2026 a Fortune 500 company offers stablecoin payroll option (for international contractors or
23employees in high-inflation countries), that normalizes it greatly. There are startups (e.g.
Remote.com, Deel) enabling this now.
• Market Structure Evolution: It’s likely by 2025 the top stablecoins will be more diversified. Today 2
issuers dominate >80%. By 2025–26, we might see 3–4 major currencies tokenized: e.g., a digital
Euro stablecoin (issued by private under new EU rules) gaining say $20B cap if Europeans start
using it for cross-border in EU. Also possibly a digital Yen or digital Pound stablecoin from
regulated exchanges in Japan/UK. While USD will remain king, non-USD stablecoin share (currently
~1%) could grow to 5–10% by late decade if those regions adopt.
• Tipping Point – Public Perception: Perhaps the biggest inflection will be when non-crypto-native
people use stablecoins regularly without thinking of them as “crypto”. This could happen through
fintech integrations – e.g., millions of Latin American users using stablecoins via their banking apps
(some banks in Argentina and Brazil already exploring). A sign of this: Mercado Libre (Latin
America’s Amazon) launched MercadoCoin in 2022 and could integrate USDP stablecoin for
wallet transfers – if these moves succeed, users transact in stablecoins but see it as just digital
dollars. 2025–2027 could see this kind of quiet mass adoption.
• Risks and Wildcards: On timeline, a negative wildcard could be a major blow-up (e.g., if Tether were
revealed unbacked and collapsed suddenly in 2026 – that could trigger a regulatory backlash and
adoption setback for years). Conversely, a positive wildcard could be a rapid emerging market shift
(imagine a consortium of African nations endorsing a USD stablecoin standard for regional trade in
2025 – could drive huge uptake). Another wild card: Big Tech, e.g., Apple launching an Apple
Stablecoin (unlikely, but if they did by 2026, that’s an overnight game-changer given Apple’s reach).
• Confidence & Trajectory: Confidence in stablecoins becoming mainstream is high if trends hold –
they have weathered crypto boom-bust and are growing in real utility. The next 2–3 years (2024–26)
are about integration and regulation. By 2027–2030, we may see stablecoins fade into the
background of finance, much like internet protocols faded behind user-friendly apps. One might
stop talking about “stablecoins” as exotic and just call them digital dollars/euros. The trajectory
resembles other fintech (credit cards, internet payments) but likely faster. As one Circle report title
put it: “The next phase of digital commerce will be built on stablecoins.” 227 228 .
• Counterintuitive Take: The biggest winners of stablecoin proliferation might be the incumbents
who embrace them, not the disruptors. This parallels how, say, Amazon embraced the internet to
dominate retail, whereas companies that ignored it fell. Banks and networks that incorporate
stablecoins (as rails or products) could extend their dominance. Already Visa and Mastercard are
positioning to ride stablecoin rails instead of fight them 229 230 . So ironically, stablecoins could
upgrade rather than uproot the financial order – fulfilling their thesis as “the most significant upgrade
of financial infrastructure since electronic banking,” to quote the question prompt. The timeline to that
upgrade being fully realized? Perhaps another 5–10 years – but the milestones above will tell us
we’re on the way.
