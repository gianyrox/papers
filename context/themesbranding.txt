Global Stablecoin Paradigm Shift: Integrated
Research Report
A. Human Themes of 2005–2026
A1. Defining Themes of the Era (2005–2026)
The period from the mid-2000s to the mid-2020s has been marked by profound social undercurrents
beyond just technology. Erosion of institutional trust is a defining theme: globally, trust in government,
media, and other institutions has declined steadily since 2005 1 . By 2026, only one-third of people say
“most people can be trusted,” with distrust now the default mindset 2 3 (Confidence: HIGH). This trust
deficit has fostered insularity and polarization. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer 2026, 70% of
people are hesitant to trust anyone with different values or backgrounds, preferring “closed ecosystems of
trust” and even nationalism over global connection 4 5 (Confidence: HIGH). “No man is an island,” wrote
John Donne, but today many have retreated into cocoons, resisting dialogue and rejecting those unlike
themselves 6 2 . This insular trend connects to rising grievance and populism: 60% worldwide feel
business and government “served only the rich”, fueling a sense of unfairness 7 (Confidence: HIGH). It’s
no surprise that political populism and anger have surged (e.g. protests, Brexit, Trump’s rise) – a backlash
to perceived elites and inequality (Confidence: HIGH, evidenced by global surveys and events).
At the same time, hyper-connectivity has transformed how people relate to each other and work. Social
media usage exploded from near-zero in 2005 to nearly 64% of the world’s population by 2025 8 .
Billions spend hours daily on platforms that flatten distance – anyone can communicate or share media
instantly. This connectedness has had a double edge: it enables community and movements, yet also
spreads misinformation and echo chambers, exacerbating the trust crisis (Confidence: HIGH – widely
documented by sociologists and media analysts). Work and identity have been disrupted by technology as
well. The smartphone/internet revolution birthed the gig economy and remote work culture. Notably,
during the pandemic, Zoom went from 10 million daily meeting participants in late 2019 to 300 million by
April 2020 9 , illustrating a massive shift to virtual work and collaboration (Confidence: HIGH). People can
earn a living from anywhere, but this also erodes traditional job security and community ties. Many
workers, especially younger generations, face precarious employment (freelancing, gig work) and are
seeking meaning and dignity in their work beyond just a paycheck (Confidence: MEDIUM – supported by
qualitative studies on millennial work attitudes).
Another deep pattern is the crisis of future optimism. A strikingly low proportion – just 15% in developed
countries – believe the next generation will be better off than today 10 (Confidence: HIGH). Events like
the 2008 financial meltdown, a slow recovery, climate change fears, and the 2020 pandemic have
contributed to a pervasive sense of uncertainty. “The risks to society—from manic swings in popular sentiment
and rejection of innovation—are real,” warns Richard Edelman, noting a global loss of optimism and
resistance to change 11 12 . Younger people especially feel anxiety about the future, from economic
stability to the climate. These concerns tie back to money: the 2008 crisis in particular was a generational
1shock that shattered faith in the financial system and left lingering cautiousness (Confidence: HIGH, widely
reported in economic and cultural commentary).
Critically, money and finance underpin many of these themes. The 2008–09 global financial crisis stands
as a watershed moment for trust in institutions (detailed in A2 below). It not only caused economic pain but
also a moral questioning: Who does the system serve? Movements like Occupy Wall Street highlighted the
human desire for fairness and accountability in finance. Additionally, inequality has become more visible –
the top 1% accumulated outsized gains, fueling public discourse about the winners and losers of
globalization (Confidence: HIGH, supported by economic data). Cultural critics like Yuval Noah Harari and
Thomas Piketty note that people in this era increasingly challenge the legitimacy of institutions that don’t
deliver broad prosperity. In hindsight from 2050, one obvious theme of 2005–2026 may be how people
began redefining trust and power – moving away from blind trust in centralized authorities (government,
banks, media) and toward peer networks, alternative systems (like crypto), or local community reliance 13
14 . This period’s deep patterns show a paradox: technology connected the world, yet society became
fractured in trust – a scenario that set the stage for new ideas about money and value exchange.
A2. Evolution of Trust (2008–2026), Especially in Finance
Trust has eroded sharply from 2008 to 2026, with financial systems at the heart of this shift. In the U.S.,
public confidence in banks collapsed after 2008: in 2007, 41% of Americans had a “great deal or quite a lot”
of trust in banks, but by 2009 only 22% did 15 . Although confidence crept back up to 38% by 2020, it never
returned to pre-crisis highs and has fallen again in recent years 16 (Confidence: HIGH, based on Gallup
longitudinal polling). This trend reflects how the near-collapse of major banks in 2008 – and their government
bailouts – fundamentally shook people’s faith in the financial establishment. As FiveThirtyEight observed,
“while a majority once had confidence in banks, that changed dramatically after 2008” 17 . The scars of the
crisis led many to question whether traditional banks deserved their trust, especially since millions lost jobs
and homes while banks were rescued (Confidence: HIGH).
Globally, surveys show trust in institutions is down across both developed and developing nations
since 2005 1 . A comprehensive UNU-WIDER study finds “a global decline in institutional trust since 2005,”
particularly a drop in trust toward governments and banks 1 . People increasingly trust those closer to
them (friends, local networks) more than big institutions, a pattern seen worldwide 18 . This helps
explain the rise of decentralized finance ethos – the idea of “trustless” systems like Bitcoin emerged
directly after 2008 as a response to vanishing trust. Indeed, Bitcoin’s pseudonymous founder Satoshi
Nakamoto embedded a 2009 newspaper headline about bank bailouts into Bitcoin’s genesis block as
commentary, hinting that Bitcoin was conceived as an alternative when trust in banks was at an all-
time low 19 20 (Confidence: HIGH). As Investopedia notes, the message in Bitcoin’s first block references
the 2008 financial crisis, symbolizing a mission to “offer an alternative to traditional financial
systems” 19 . This historical footnote underscores how trust shifted – from institutional trust toward
system trust in code and networks.
By 2026, trust remains “in peril”, according to Edelman’s latest data 21 . There is a 15-point trust gap
between high-income and low-income groups globally (29 points in the U.S.), reflecting how economic
divides map onto trust divides 22 . Those left behind economically tend to be far more distrustful of the
financial system’s fairness (Confidence: HIGH). Young people’s trust is particularly shaky: Research finds
that younger generations in many countries report lower trust in institutions than older folks 23 , likely due
to coming of age in turbulent times (2008 crash, political instability, pandemic). The 2008 crisis is a common
2reference point: it not only depressed trust initially, but its aftereffects (a decade of slow wage growth for
many, rising inequality) kept skepticism alive. Even in 2023, events like bank failures (e.g. Silicon Valley
Bank’s collapse) quickly revived public fears – though surveys showed most Americans still felt their own
deposits were “somewhat or very safe,” 54% thought that a broader financial crisis was at least somewhat
likely after SVB’s failure 24 (Confidence: MEDIUM, one-time poll). This demonstrates how fragile trust
remains: confidence can be rattled easily because the baseline level is low.
It’s important to note that trust in financial systems varies widely by country. Gallup’s 2022 global survey
found trust in financial institutions ranged from a mere 4% in Lebanon (amid a severe banking crisis) to 95%
in Kuwait 25 26 . Generally, countries with recent banking upheavals or inflation crises have seen trust
plummet – e.g. Lebanon’s near-universal lack of faith in banks after its currency collapse 25 27 . In
contrast, places with stable economies or strict regulation (like Singapore) maintain higher public
confidence 28 29 . Trust is closely tied to perceived stability: people trust banks when they are seen as
safe and well-regulated, and lose trust when they experience instability or unfairness 30 31 . Over 2008–
2026, many developed countries managed to shore up bank safety through regulations, but the reputational
damage was done. As one U.S. regulator noted in 2022, “Banks have done a commendable job of rebuilding
trust since the 2008 crisis,” but public perception data suggests full trust was never restored 32 16
(Confidence: HIGH for trend, MEDIUM for qualitative assessment).
In summary, trust has evolved from a relatively naïve high in the early 2000s to a much more skeptical,
verify-before-trusting stance by 2026. This is especially true toward financial systems. The 2008 crisis was a
pivotal break in trust, birthing both a cultural cynicism about Wall Street and technological movements
(FinTech, crypto) aiming to create new trust models. By 2026, a majority of people seem to agree with the
sentiment: “Trust must be earned – and right now, our financial institutions haven’t fully earned it back.”
(Confidence: HIGH, supported by multi-source data).
A3. Connected Everything – Except Money? (Why Money Lags)
Over the past two decades, human society became hyper-connected in media, work, and commerce, yet
money has lagged behind in seamless connectivity. By 2025, 63.9% of the world uses social media,
sharing information across the globe instantly 8 . News, videos, and ideas cross borders online with
minimal friction. Likewise, work has been transformed by connectivity: collaboration tools and telepresence
mean a project team can be spread across four continents and still work in real-time. The COVID-19
pandemic dramatically accelerated remote work – e.g. Zoom’s user base rocketed from 10 million daily
meeting participants in Dec 2019 to 300 million by April 2020 9 – a 30× increase in three months
(Confidence: HIGH). Commerce, too, is fundamentally connected: global e-commerce sales hit an
estimated $6.42 trillion in 2025, making up 20.5% of all retail 33 . A person in New Jersey can buy hand-
crafted goods from Indonesia with a few clicks, and businesses source parts and services worldwide. In
short, information, communication, and trade have largely been “internet-ified,” operating on instant,
networked rails.
Money, however, remains fragmented and often slow. The internet enabled the free flow of data, but the
free flow of value has been hampered by legacy financial systems and national borders. A telling statistic:
Cross-border payments are still far slower and costlier than domestic payments. According to the Bank for
International Settlements, sending money abroad costs several times more and takes much longer
than a domestic digital payment 34 . In Q1 2025, the global average cost to send a $200 remittance was
6.5% (i.e. $13 fee) 35 . Even in the cheapest region (South Asia), it averaged 4.8% 36 . By contrast, domestic
3fast-payment systems typically charge <1% in fees 37 . (Confidence: HIGH – these are World Bank and BIS
figures). Moreover, an international bank transfer can take days to clear due to intermediary banks and
compliance checks, whereas an email or WhatsApp message zips across in seconds. As the BIS summarized,
“Cross-border payments, by contrast, have not kept up with the progress…they cost more, take longer, and are less
transparent” 38 .
Why does money lag? A key reason is that money is tied to trust and sovereignty in a way data is not.
Moving money involves complying with regulations (to prevent fraud, money laundering, etc.) and often
currency conversion between nations. The correspondent banking network, essentially a 20th-century
infrastructure (SWIFT dates to the 1970s), hasn’t fully modernized. In fact, the number of correspondent
banking relationships worldwide has been shrinking, creating bottlenecks in cross-border flows 39 .
Political and security concerns also slow innovation – e.g. sanctions and know-your-customer rules add
friction. By 2026, we do have innovations like mobile money in developing countries and some blockchain-
based transfers, but globally money’s “internet moment” trails behind media’s. Don Tapscott, a leading
tech author, puts it this way: for decades we had the Internet of Information, and now we’re just getting the
Internet of Value 40 . He calls blockchain the foundation of a “second era of the internet… the internet of
value” where money and assets can move as freely as emails 41 . (Confidence: HIGH that this view is
influential, though there are competing views on timing).
It’s notable that certain parts of the economy have been fully connected except for the payment. For
example, a freelancer in Kenya can find a client in Canada online (work connection made), send them a
design file instantly (media/data transfer done), but then wait days or incur high fees to get paid for that
work (money transfer lags). This mismatch has driven demand for better solutions. Stablecoins and digital
currencies emerged to try to fill this gap (discussed in A5), allowing value transfer on internet time. By 2024,
the on-chain transaction volume of stablecoins reached $27.6 trillion for the year 42 , and in one quarter
of 2024 stablecoins processed $8.5 trillion – more than double Visa’s volume in the same period 43 .
This astonishing statistic (Confidence: HIGH, source data from a16z/Flagship Advisory) indicates that
technically, money can move as fast as information when using crypto rails. However, note that over 95% of
that stablecoin volume is wholesale or crypto trading; only ~5% (≈$1.3 trillion) was payments for real goods
and services 42 . So while the pipes for instant global money flow are being built, mainstream usage lags
due to usability, regulation, and trust barriers (Confidence: HIGH – multiple reports echo this).
Another aspect is connectivity vs. money inclusion. The internet connected billions, yet nearly 1.4 billion
adults remain unbanked as of 2021 44 . People can stream YouTube in remote villages but might not have
a safe way to save $50. This irony is not lost on development experts: “Our financial system remains outdated:
slow, expensive, and inaccessible to billions,” as one fintech CEO put it in 2025 45 . Money lagging is not just
technological; it’s also about policy and social choice. Media and commerce had fewer gatekeepers than
finance does – anyone can publish a blog, but not anyone can issue a currency or move money without
oversight. Thus, money’s evolution has been slower by design.
In summary, everything else (media, communication, work, shopping) has leapt into a real-time
global network, while money is still catching up. The costs and delays in cross-border payments are the
clearest evidence of this lag 46 47 . However, the gap is closing: from PayPal and mobile wallets to
cryptocurrency networks, new systems are emerging to make sending value as easy as sending a text. The
tension between the old guard (banks, regulators ensuring stability) and the new tech (stablecoins, fintech) is
why money’s transformation is slower and more contentious. But by 2026, even skeptics acknowledge that
4the pressure for money to fully join the internet era is high – and stablecoins are a leading contender in
that push (Confidence: HIGH).
A4. Participation and Dignity: Financial Exclusion as a Human Issue
Access (or lack thereof) to financial systems has increasingly been framed as a human dignity issue in this
era. Roughly 1.4 billion adults worldwide have no bank account 44 – that’s nearly a quarter of adults left
out of basic financial tools. An additional 400 million have an account but rarely use it, meaning they’re
effectively underserved 44 . This exclusion often aligns with poverty, gender, and geography: for instance,
women and rural poor are disproportionately unbanked. The human impact is severe. As one fintech
organization describes, “Financial exclusion amplifies vulnerability, keeps families in cycles of poverty, and holds
back entire communities from progress.” 48 (Confidence: HIGH). Without access to saving, credit, or
insurance, everyday life is precarious – emergencies become catastrophes and opportunities (like starting a
small business or pursuing education) stay out of reach.
Crucially, thought leaders now talk about financial inclusion in terms of dignity, opportunity, and
choice. A 2025 essay from an African fintech startup (eShandi) states: “At the heart of it all is something far
more human – dignity, opportunity, and choice.” 49 . People don’t want handouts; they want tools to take
control of their financial lives. Not having a safe place to store money, or an easy way to send support to
family, or a means to prove creditworthiness – these are not just economic problems, but blows to one’s
dignity (Confidence: HIGH, supported by many NGO and World Bank reports). It means being invisible in
the modern economy. Indeed, the LinkedIn article emphasizes how those “invisible to the financial system”
are invisible to opportunity 50 . There’s a growing consensus that in the 21st century, access to basic financial
services is as essential as access to clean water or electricity – it underpins the ability to improve one’s life
(Confidence: HIGH among development experts).
Exclusion also intersects with trust. Some of the unbanked chose not to participate due to lack of trust in
institutions. In the U.S., for example, 13% of unbanked households in 2021 cited “don’t trust banks” as a
reason for not having an account 51 . Globally, communities with histories of discrimination by banks or
unstable banks often avoid them. This highlights a vicious cycle: those who could benefit most from
financial tools are wary of them, sometimes with good reason (Confidence: MEDIUM). For them, new
models like mobile money or community-based finance can be game-changers if done right.
Stablecoins and fintech have emerged as potential equalizers in this arena. A World Economic Forum
piece in 2026 noted that stablecoins can expand financial access in developing markets 52 . We already see
evidence: in countries with unstable currencies or strict capital controls, people have turned to stablecoins
(which are typically USD-pegged) as a lifeline. “Stablecoins have become financial lifelines in many emerging
economies, giving people easier access to stable currency (often US dollars) where local currencies are unstable,”
reports a 2024 crypto advisory study 53 (Confidence: HIGH). For example, Argentines facing 100% inflation
use USDT (Tether) to store value and even for daily transactions at some groceries. In Venezuela, a
grassroots trend saw dollar stablecoins used in retail when bolivar inflation made cash next to worthless.
These anecdotes show the direct human impact: financial inclusion via stablecoins is not abstract – it
means a shopkeeper can preserve her earnings, or a migrant worker can send money home instantly
for a few cents instead of a hefty fee.
However, technology alone isn’t a silver bullet. Education and empowerment are crucial. Many exclusion
issues come down to “systems not built with the poor in mind” 54 . Fintech can redesign for dignity – e.g.
5simpler onboarding without tons of paperwork (since many excluded lack formal IDs or proof of address),
interfaces in local languages, and micro-sized services that match the needs of low-income users 55 56 .
One surprise theme is the rise of financial health as a concept: not just access, but usage that genuinely
benefits people. For instance, simply giving out accounts isn’t enough if fees are high or the user doesn’t
trust the institution. That’s why participation must be accompanied by respect and consumer protection. In
the drive for inclusion, experts highlight the importance of agency – people feeling in control of their
money. Being included should mean empowered, not exploited by predatory lenders or surveilled by Big
Brother (Confidence: HIGH – reflected in global principles for financial inclusion).
A human story to illustrate: during the pandemic, governments that could send payments digitally
(stimulus, aid) got relief to people faster, while those reliant on cash distribution struggled. This spurred
interest in digital cash transfers as a standard tool. The UN and World Bank are actively promoting digital
financial services as a way to achieve several Sustainable Development Goals, precisely because it relates to
poverty reduction, gender equality, and more (Confidence: HIGH). In other words, financial inclusion is
now seen as foundational to broader human development.
In sum, exclusion from financial systems is increasingly recognized as a matter of human dignity. It’s
not just a banking problem; it’s a social problem. “Access isn’t a privilege. It’s a foundation,” as the eShandi
article succinctly put it 57 . Key findings: billions unbanked, clear negative impacts on well-being, but new
tech like stablecoins offers hope by bypassing old barriers (Confidence: HIGH on data; MEDIUM on how
quickly tech will solve it). A caution: inclusion efforts must be accompanied by trust-building and education,
otherwise the most vulnerable might simply be pushed from one form of exclusion to another. The
encouraging development is that many now view financial inclusion as a basic need – a shift in mindset
that could drive lasting change.
A5. The Nature of Money: Does Changing Its Form Change Us?
The period 2005–2026 has seen money itself begin to change form – from paper cash and bank balances to
digital and decentralized forms like stablecoins – prompting the question: does changing money’s form
change society or human behavior? The answer appears to be both yes and no, with competing
perspectives from economists, technologists, and sociologists (Confidence: MEDIUM, as this is an evolving
debate).
On one hand, some argue that money’s essence remains the same even if the form shifts. A theoretical
analysis of stablecoins notes “the essence of stablecoin is the same as money, which is a kind of credit” 58 . In
this view, money has always been a tool to represent value and trust between parties, whether it’s shells,
paper, or bits on a blockchain. Changing to a stablecoin doesn’t change fundamental human behaviors like
the need for trust, the propensity to trade, or the psychology of saving and spending. For example, if a
family in Nigeria uses a digital naira stablecoin instead of cash naira, their economic goals and challenges
(earning a living, protecting against inflation) remain. Thus, simply digitizing money might not
revolutionize human nature; people might still panic in a bank run or overspend if they lack financial
literacy (Confidence: HIGH that this conservative view is held by many central bankers and economists).
However, there is a compelling case that changing money’s form does change how we behave and
organize society, by altering the speed, transparency, and accessibility of transactions. When money
becomes information-rich and programmable, it enables new interactions. For instance, stablecoins allow
24/7, instant transactions across borders 59 . This has never been possible with traditional money at
6scale. As Rizon’s CEO Ignas Survila said in 2025, “The emergence of stablecoins…is not just another crypto trend,
but a fundamental shift in how money flows” 45 59 . If value can flow as freely as email, it could unlock
economic activities that were previously impractical – micro-payments for content, real-time revenue
sharing, pay-as-you-go insurance, etc. These innovations could change our relationship with money by
embedding it seamlessly into digital life (Confidence: MEDIUM – early evidence exists, but mainstream
adoption is nascent).
Moreover, changing money can change power dynamics and trust models. Stablecoins and
cryptocurrencies shift some power from central authorities to networks and users. They introduce the idea
of “trust in code” versus trust in banks. This is a sociological shift: people begin to place faith in
decentralized systems or communities (e.g. holders of a decentralized stablecoin collectively governing its
rules) rather than traditional hierarchies. Who we trust to manage money might change – which is a
profound societal shift if it endures (Confidence: MEDIUM, as crypto adoption is still limited, but growing in
influence). Additionally, stablecoins (especially if widely adopted) could change geopolitics of currency. For
example, a widely used USD stablecoin in emerging markets can dollarize economies in a bottom-up way,
potentially reducing the power of local governments to control monetary policy. That could bring stability
but also loss of sovereignty – a double-edged sword for societies (Confidence: MEDIUM).
Another way form affects us is through data and transparency. Digital money can be tracked and
analyzed far more easily than cash. This raises surveillance vs. privacy debates. As one analysis pointed out,
blockchain’s public ledger can expose transaction histories in granular detail, and proposed regulations could
create a “surveillance infrastructure rivaled only by central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)” if not checked 60
61 . So if money’s form changes to fully traceable, human behavior might change due to awareness of
being watched. People might be less inclined to, say, tip a dissident group or make certain purchases if
they know every cent is monitored. This is a behavioral shift tied purely to money’s form (from anonymous
cash to traceable stablecoin) – not to the money’s function per se (Confidence: HIGH that this effect is real,
as evidenced by existing digital surveillance in banking deterring some transactions).
From a philosophical angle, money is a social contract. Changing its form can either reinforce or challenge
social norms. Consider the concept of programmable money: a company could issue stablecoins that can
only be spent on specific items (like food tokens). That might improve efficiency or prevent misuse of funds,
but it also constrains personal freedom, potentially altering the notion of money as fungible and freely
usable. Experiments in UBI (universal basic income) via digital currency are testing whether attaching
conditions to money changes recipients’ behaviors for the better (e.g. healthier spending choices) or if it
undermines dignity (Confidence: LOW so far, as experiments are ongoing and value-laden).
Importantly, stablecoins themselves vary. Some are centralized (run by companies) – these don’t radically
change the trust model (you still trust an issuer, like trusting a bank). Others are decentralized algorithms –
these are newer and in some cases failed spectacularly (e.g. the TerraUST collapse in 2022), reminding us
that trust doesn’t disappear, it shifts. After Terra’s failure, many became more skeptical of algorithmic
stablecoins, reinforcing trust in more traditional asset-backed ones (Confidence: HIGH, given market data
post-2022). This suggests that not all form changes are equal: forms that successfully preserve trust will
change usage patterns more than those that do not.
One clear change from digital currency is financial democratization. With stablecoins, anyone with a
smartphone can effectively have a dollar account, even if they live in a country with a weak banking
system. This is potentially transformative: it could bring millions into the global economy, boost
7entrepreneurship in developing regions, and reduce dependency on local fiat that might be inflating
(Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH; early trends in Africa, Latin America support this). The dignity angle appears
here too – e.g. Venezuelan professionals paid in stablecoins feel they have a lifeline to true value, restoring
a sense of control over their economic fate that was lost with a collapsing bolivar. That psychological and
social change – reclaiming agency – is tied to money’s new form (digital, borderless, relatively stable in
value).
In conclusion, changing money’s form is changing us, but incrementally and with caveats. Where
money’s new form (stablecoins, etc.) removes friction and expands access, we see positive changes: greater
inclusion, new economic models, perhaps a more level playing field globally. A recent World Bank report
even estimated stablecoins could save $39 billion in annual remittance fees for users, effectively
transferring wealth back to families and away from intermediaries 62 (Confidence: HIGH on potential
impact). At the same time, where the new form introduces new risks (surveillance, volatility), we face
societal choices about values – privacy vs. security, decentralization vs. regulation.
So, does stablecoin digital money change us? It doesn’t change basic human nature (people will still
seek security, speculate, fear loss), but it changes the environment in which decisions are made. Faster,
more accessible money can make markets more efficient and inclusive – or more volatile if not managed. It
can increase personal freedom – or state oversight, depending on design. In a sense, the nature of money is
indeed changing, as every aspect of life digitizes 63 , but whether it changes us for better or worse depends
on how we govern this transition (Confidence: MEDIUM). One thing is clear: we are thinking about money in
new ways now – as a technology and a public good – in a way that perhaps we didn’t before 2008. That
meta-change in perspective may itself be one of the era’s legacies.
B. Book Craft & Branding Strategy
B1. Lasting vs. Dated Comparable Titles
When positioning a nonfiction book about a paradigm shift in money, it’s critical to learn from past books –
which ones remain timeless versus those that now feel dated – and why. Timeless books tend to address
fundamental questions or historical sweeps, whereas dated titles often latch onto transient trends or near-
term predictions (Confidence: HIGH, general publishing insight 64 65 ).
For example, Niall Ferguson’s The Ascent of Money (2008) has lasting value. It traces the financial history of
the world, extracting lessons from centuries of money evolution. Even though published right after the
2008 crisis, its broad historical narrative means readers in 2026 (or 2050) can still gain insights from
medieval banking or the bond markets of the 1800s. It doesn’t feel stale because it wasn’t pegged to the
latest hype; it was rooted in enduring context (Confidence: HIGH – still frequently cited). Similarly, David
Graeber’s Debt: The First 5,000 Years (2011) remains relevant due to its anthropological depth on money
and credit across eras. These books feel timeless because they speak to overarching human themes (trust,
debt, power) rather than ephemeral tech.
In contrast, consider a book like Thomas Friedman’s The World Is Flat (2005). At the time, it was seminal in
discussing globalization and technology’s impact. But today parts of it feel dated – it was very excited about
the early internet and outsourcing, and missed later phenomena (like social media’s dark side or the
backlash of nationalism). Its title metaphor “flat world” still resonates, but some case studies (e.g. specific
companies or technologies) now seem out-of-date. The lesson: a book deeply tied to the zeitgeist of a
8specific moment can later read as a time capsule rather than a perennial guide. Many early books on social
media or mobile tech (e.g. praising MySpace, BlackBerry, etc.) suffer this fate (Confidence: HIGH – we’ve
seen the tech landscape shift rapidly, stranding once-timely analyses).
For our domain, look at crypto and fintech books. The Age of Cryptocurrency (Vigna & Casey, 2015) was one
of the first mainstream books on Bitcoin/blockchain. It did an excellent job explaining the tech and its
revolutionary promise. However, it inevitably feels a bit dated now because the crypto world has evolved
(e.g. Ethereum and DeFi emerged, regulatory environment changed). What gives it some lasting value is
that it framed Bitcoin in terms of challenging the global economic order (per its subtitle) 66 , a big-picture
theme. But parts of it (like the state of mining or specific companies in 2014) are historical snapshots.
Similarly, Nathaniel Popper’s Digital Gold (2015) is a history of Bitcoin’s early days – as history, it remains
valuable and even more so as time passes (like reading about the dawn of the Internet). But as a guide to
current crypto, it’s outdated. The difference is lasting comp titles often either take a historical/analytical
angle or focus on human stories, whereas dated titles often focus on forecasting or hype that doesn’t
pan out. Books that in 2017 predicted blockchain would immediately revolutionize everything by 2020 now
look overly optimistic.
Another point: enduring books focus on principles, not just facts. Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s Skin in the
Game (2018) deals with risk and incentive – principles that apply in any era (hence it stays in reading lists)
67 . In contrast, a book like The Fintech Revolution 2016 (hypothetical title) full of then-current startup
examples might feel obsolete if many startups folded or the landscape shifted. Indeed, business books built
around “case studies of today’s top companies” can become dated when those companies decline. For
instance, Good to Great (2001) examined leading companies of the 90s – some of which later stumbled –
making readers question the longevity of its lessons (Confidence: HIGH; it’s well-known many Good to Great
companies didn’t remain great). As one analysis quipped, “Extremely relevant and a huge best-seller in the
2000s. Today, almost completely irrelevant.” 68 about such case-study-driven books.
Competing perspectives on this: Authors of timely books might argue they meet an immediate need even
if they date. For example, a 2021 book on NFTs might not be timeless, but during the 2021–22 boom it
could sell massively and educate many (short-term success). Meanwhile, a timeless-oriented book like
Money: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing (which covers money conceptually) sells steadily over a long period.
The key for our book is to strike a balance: provide timely insight into stablecoins (as a new
phenomenon) while framing it in timeless human context (trust, participation, future of money).
In summary, lasting books are those that readers still pick up a decade later because their content is
foundational or their storytelling is compelling beyond the moment. Dated books often show their age in
title or content (e.g. “The Facebook Era” – clearly tied to a certain platform and likely not aging well as
platforms change). For our project, comps that succeeded long-term (like The Sovereign Individual (1997)
which astonishingly foresaw digital currency and cyber economies 69 ) did so because they engaged big
ideas and didn’t limit themselves to 1997’s milieu (that book reads almost more relevant today than when
written, a hallmark of prescience). We aim for that kind of longevity. (Confidence in these assessments: HIGH,
based on observable publication histories and current recommendations.)
B2. Title and Naming Conventions in This Genre
Nonfiction book titles, especially in the business/technology/finance genre, often follow a "Hook:
Explanation" format. A catchy, evocative main title grabs attention, and a subtitle conveys the subject and
9stakes. For instance, “Bitcoin: The Future of Money?” (2014) by Dominic Frisby poses a provocative question in
the title and signals its scope 70 . Similarly, “The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin and Digital Money Are
Challenging the Global Economic Order” combines a grand era-defining phrase with a clear subtitle 66 . This
convention of “Main Title: Subtitle” is extremely common and effective (Confidence: HIGH, standard industry
practice). We should expect to craft something similar for our book on stablecoins.
Main titles in this space often use metaphor or impactful keywords. Examples of single-word or two-
word hooks: “Digital Gold” (Popper’s book) uses a metaphor equating Bitcoin to gold 71 . “The Sovereign
Individual” uses a strong image of personal empowerment. “Daylight Robbery” (Dominic Frisby, 2019) uses an
idiom to talk about tax, piquing curiosity 72 . Titles like “Who Can You Trust?” (Rachel Botsman, 2017) use a
question to draw in readers to a theme of trust in the digital age 73 . In our case, words like “Trust,”
“Money,” “Future,” “Dollar,” “Revolution,” “Connected,” “Global,” or a play on “stable/unstable” could be
powerful. For instance, a potential hook could be “Stable Money, Unstable World” or “Trustless” (a play
on the crypto term and trust issues). The title should intrigue a mainstream skeptical reader – so it should
neither be too jargon-y (avoid acronyms or technical terms like “CBDC” or “DeFi” in the main title) nor too
bland.
Subtitles usually do the explanatory heavy lifting: specifying the topic and promise. They often contain a
colon and a longer description. Common patterns include: - “How X is Y-ing Z” (cause-effect structure): e.g.
“How Bitcoin and Blockchain Are Challenging the Global Economic Order” 66 or “How the Digital Revolution
is Transforming Currencies and Finance” (subtitle of Eswar Prasad’s The Future of Money, 2021). This format
works well to articulate the book’s core argument or scope. - “The [Adjective] [Noun] of [Something]”: e.g. “The
Decentralized Alternative to Central Banking” (subtitle of The Bitcoin Standard) 74 or “The Inside Story of the
Misfits and Millionaires Trying to Reinvent Money” (Popper’s Digital Gold subtitle). This often provides
context or narrative hint. - Inclusion of timeframe or stakes: e.g. “... in the Twenty-First Century” or “... and the
Future of ...”.
For our stablecoin book, the subtitle likely should include the word “stablecoin” or “global currency” to
immediately signal the unique angle. It might also highlight a human angle or paradigm shift. For example, a
structure could be “Stablecoins and the Fight for Financial Inclusion” or “...the New War over Trust and Money”.
Our naming should capitalize on familiarity where helpful (“digital dollar” might resonate more than
“stablecoin” alone for some readers), but also establish the distinct paradigm shift so it doesn’t sound like
just another crypto book.
Naming conventions trend: Many books in our area use epochal framing (“The Age of…”, “The Future
of…”, “The New…”). This gives a sense that the book explains this moment in history. Another convention is
using contrasts or paradox in the title: “The Curse of Cash” (Kenneth Rogoff, 2016) juxtaposes cash
(generally seen as good) with curse 75 . We could consider a contrast like “Stablecoin Chaos” (though that
sounds negative) or “Certain Money in Uncertain Times”. Alliteration or rhyme can make a title roll off the
tongue (e.g. “Digital Dollar Dilemma” – as a hypothetical). However, clarity is more important than cleverness
for a mainstream book: we want the prospective reader to grasp the subject from the title/subtitle
immediately. An agent’s rule of thumb is that title/subtitle together should convey the genre and topic
clearly. For instance, The Internet of Money (Antonopoulos series) clearly signals it’s about money on the
internet 76 .
10Author name usage: Since this is a first-time author, the title should be idea-focused rather than author-
focused. In publishing, unless you’re a celebrity, your name won’t sell the book – the idea will 77 78 . So we
won’t do something like “John Doe’s Guide to Stablecoins”; instead, we’ll use the conventions above.
In summary, we’ll likely adopt a two-part title. The main part could be short, possibly metaphorical or
posing a question, and the subtitle will spell out stablecoins, money, and why it matters now. For example:
“The Last Unconnected Piece: How Stablecoins Could Unite Money with the Internet” (just as a pattern). Or “Trust
and Money in the Age of Stablecoins: Connecting Finance in a Fragmented World.” These follow the observed
conventions: indicate an age or a big topic, include a colon, and mention stablecoins and the larger human
issue (trust, fragmentation, inclusion, etc).
(Confidence: HIGH in these observations, as they are drawn from numerous title examples and publishing best
practices.)
B4. What Makes a Book Feel Timeless vs. Timely
To ensure our book resonates beyond the immediate moment, we must build in evergreen qualities. A
timeless book often: focuses on enduring themes, uses stories and lessons that don’t expire, and avoids
overly specific forecasts or slang. A timely book, by contrast, might exploit current buzz and detail, but can
lose relevance as events unfold.
From the research and expert writing advice, a key strategy is: focus on big, universal questions. As one
author put it, “The size of the question dictates the size of the audience.” 79 To have longevity, tackle questions
that remain interesting year after year. In our case: “How does trust in money affect society?” or “What is the
future of money in a digital world?” are enduring questions. If we frame stablecoins as an illustration of those,
the book stays relevant even if specific technologies change. Conversely, if we framed it narrowly like
“Investment opportunities in stablecoins for 2026”, it would be obsolete by 2027 (and also far less interesting
to a broad readership). Indeed, books that read like extended news articles or trend reports usually have a
short shelf life.
Avoiding too much “tech speak” and ephemeral references is crucial. For example, mentioning specific
coin prices, or minor companies that might not exist in 2 years, can date the text. It’s better to say “a major
stablecoin collapsed in 2022, demonstrating the risks of algorithmic designs” than to hinge the narrative
entirely on Terra/Luna – because in 2030, Terra is old news, but the lesson (risk of certain stablecoin designs)
still matters. By abstracting one level and emphasizing principles, the content remains fresh (Confidence:
HIGH – this technique is commonly advised for business writing). An industry insider, Nicolas Cole, notes
that data/insights get outdated within a decade in many fields, so leaning too much on current data can
make a book timely not timeless 80 . Our solution: use data to support points (giving credibility) but make
sure each point ties to a larger narrative or truth that will likely hold. For instance, citing the trust decline
statistics from Edelman in 2026 is great evidence, but the narrative should be “trust in institutions is
eroding” – a trend likely to be discussed for many years – rather than “2026 is the peak of insularity” which
might not age well if 2027 reverses it.
Another tactic for timelessness is storytelling – telling human stories that illustrate the point. Human
stories (a Venezuelan merchant using stablecoins to survive hyperinflation, an American millennial losing
trust after 2008, etc.) are relatable and don’t rely on being up-to-the-minute. People will always empathize
with personal journeys or historical anecdotes. It’s the difference between a textbook and a narrative
11nonfiction. Narrative tends to age better because it’s literature, not just information. This is why Liar’s Poker
(1989, Michael Lewis) is still read – it’s a story about Wall Street culture, not just a market analysis of the late
80s. For our book, weaving in narrative elements (e.g. the origin story of a stablecoin, or a user’s life change
through financial inclusion) can provide lasting emotional resonance.
Competing perspective: One might argue that being too general can make a book bland. Indeed, to feel
timeless, the book shouldn’t shy away from details – it should use them judiciously. The goal is to root
timeless insights in timely examples. For example, discussing the 2008 crisis or 2020 pandemic is
important (future readers will recall these major events), but always connecting them to the book’s core
themes (like trust or technology acceleration) ensures the discussion isn’t just “recent history” but part of a
continuum.
Language and tone also matter. Avoiding trendy buzzwords or overly informal internet slang will help the
book age well. A formal but engaging style (as seen in books like Sapiens or The Innovator’s Dilemma) tends
not to feel dated, whereas a book peppered with “as we see on Facebook and Twitter feeds” might feel very
2010s in tone to a 2030s reader (Confidence: MEDIUM – language effects are somewhat subjective, but
many editors advise caution on this).
Finally, including multiple perspectives or scenarios can future-proof the content. If we acknowledge, for
instance, both the utopian and dystopian possibilities of digital currency, then whatever happens, the book
had it covered. Single-outcome predictions (e.g. “By 2030, cash will be gone”) can make a book look bad if
that doesn’t happen. A timeless-feeling book entertains different outcomes. This nuanced approach builds
trust with skeptical readers too – showing we’re not evangelists with blinders, but thoughtful analysts.
In essence, to feel timeless, our book should be concept-driven and human-driven, not just technology-
driven. It will frame stablecoins in the long arc of money and human trust, so that even if someone reads it
in 2040, they gain understanding of how this early 21st-century shift fit into larger patterns. If we do that
successfully, the book can age gracefully like a bottle of wine rather than spoiling like old news. (Confidence:
HIGH in these guidelines – they align with known longevity of other works and professional advice on evergreen
writing 81 82 .)
B6. Proposed Book Titles (15–20 Strong Options)
Below is a list of 15 potential titles with subtitles, crafted to capture the book’s themes and appeal to a
mainstream, skeptical audience. Each pairs a concise, intriguing hook with a clarifying subtitle:
1. Trustless: How Stablecoins and Digital Cash Are Rewriting Our Faith in Money – (“Trustless” plays
on the crypto term and the trust theme. Subtitle emphasizes paradigm shift in trust and money.)
2. The Last Offline Frontier: Money in a Connected World – Subtitle: “Why Currency Lagged Behind and
How Stablecoins Will Change That.”
3. Stablecoin Nation: The New Age of Money and the Battle for Inclusion – Implies a broad
movement (“nation”) and conflict over financial inclusion.
4. In Money We Trust? Stablecoins, Banks, and the Global Crisis of Confidence – Poses the core
question and signals skepticism, good for a wary reader.
5. Connected Currency: Bridging the Gap Between the Internet and Your Wallet – Alliteration and
clear image of linking internet tech with everyday money.
126. The Internet of Value: When Money Becomes Digital (and What It Means for Us) – Leverages the
“internet of value” concept in accessible terms.
7. Certain Money in Uncertain Times: Stablecoins and the Future of Finance – Contrast of certainty
vs uncertainty highlights stablecoins’ promise in volatility.
8. Democratizing the Dollar: How Stablecoins Open Finance to the World’s Unbanked – Emphasizes
inclusion and the US dollar as a global reference.
9. The Trust Shift: From Banks to Blockchains in the Quest for Stable Money – Captures the shift in
who we trust with money.
10. Unchained Value: Stablecoins, Freedom, and the New Money Revolution – “Unchained” suggests
liberation from old systems (also hint to blockchain).
11. The Global Money Reset: Stablecoins and the End of Financial Exclusion – Dramatic, suggests a
reboot of the financial order to include everyone.
12. Beyond Bitcoin: The Rise of Stablecoins and the Next Monetary Revolution – Positions stablecoins
as the next chapter after Bitcoin, appealing to those who heard of Bitcoin but ask “what’s next?”.
13. Safe Harbor: How Digital Stablecoins Became a Lifeline in Turbulent Economies – Uses a
metaphor (harbor in a storm) and highlights real use in crises.
14. The Currency of Trust: Why Stablecoins Matter for Money’s Future – Emphasizes trust as a
currency itself and stablecoins’ relevance.
15. Cash 2.0: Stablecoins and the Reinvention of Money – Short, techy hook (“Cash 2.0”) with a subtitle to
explain scope.
Each of these tries to balance clarity and intrigue. For instance, “Trustless” as a one-word title begs the
question (trustless what?), answered by the subtitle about stablecoins and cash – this would attract a tech-
aware reader but also interest anyone curious about trust in money. “In Money We Trust?” twists the familiar
motto “In God We Trust,” immediately signaling a critical examination of confidence in currency; the subtitle
then grounds it in stablecoins and global context, which a skeptical reader concerned about banks and
crypto would appreciate. Titles like “The Last Offline Frontier” or “Connected Currency” highlight the narrative
that everything else went online, only money lagged – a somewhat surprising angle that a tech insider may
have missed. Meanwhile, “Democratizing the Dollar” and “Global Money Reset” lean into the inclusion theme,
which is an overlooked human angle beyond just tech.
We also see different tones: some (The Trust Shift, The Currency of Trust) are a bit academic/serious; others
(Cash 2.0, Beyond Bitcoin) are punchier and trendier. This gives a range to test with agents/publishers. The
ideal final title might combine elements: for example, an agent might love “The Trust Shift” but prefer a
subtitle from another option.
(Confidence: HIGH that these titles align with market conventions, given they mirror patterns of known successful
titles while injecting our book’s unique angle. Final selection would benefit from feedback from publishing
professionals and test audiences.)
C. Publishing Strategy for a First-Time Nonfiction Author (2026)
C1. Publisher Fit: Who Might Publish This Book?
For a global, paradigm-shift nonfiction project like this, traditional trade publishers (the major publishing
houses or well-regarded independent presses) are the primary target. A first-time author typically would
13seek an agent who in turn pitches to these publishers’ imprints that handle business, technology, or current
affairs titles. Based on comparable books:
• Penguin Random House – Imprints like Portfolio, Penguin Press, or Crown specialize in accessible
business/tech thought-leadership books. For example, Penguin’s Portfolio imprint publishes
technology trend books and could be a good home if the book leans into business implications. PRH
also has Dutton or Viking which sometimes do big idea books.
• HarperCollins – Harper Business or HarperOne might be interested. Harper published Digital Gold by
Popper 83 , showing they have appetite for cryptocurrency topics. HarperOne often does books at
the intersection of technology and social issues, which could fit if our book emphasizes cultural
impact.
• Simon & Schuster – Imprints like Scribner or Free Press (historically) have done economic narratives.
S&S published The Sovereign Individual originally, and they might consider a forward-looking money
book, especially if the proposal is strong on narrative.
• Hachette Book Group – PublicAffairs (part of Hachette) is known for serious nonfiction on policy,
economics, and global affairs. Given PublicAffairs published Rachel Botsman’s Who Can You Trust?
(2017) and other tech-society books, they could be a top contender (Confidence: HIGH – PublicAffairs
actively acquires in this space). Hachette’s Basic Books imprint is another which loves well-researched
big idea books, especially if written in a journalistic or analytical style.
• Macmillan – St. Martin’s Press or its sub-imprint St. Martin’s Griffin published The Age of Cryptocurrency
84 , indicating openness to crypto topics. Also, Farrar, Straus and Giroux (FSG), while more literary,
has an FSG Originals line for creative nonfiction. For something very global and idea-driven, Henry
Holt (another Macmillan imprint) might be worth considering too.
• Wiley – While Wiley is not a trade publisher in the Big Five sense, it is a respected publisher
especially for finance and technical finance books. The Bitcoin Standard (2018) was published by Wiley
85 . Wiley might be a fit if the book leans more towards finance professionals or is somewhat
academic in tone. They can handle global distribution and have credibility in finance (Confidence:
HIGH for credibility, though Wiley’s marketing to general audiences may be less punchy than a true
trade press).
• MIT Press or Oxford University Press – These are more academic, but MIT Press in particular has
been publishing accessible books on digital currency and finance (e.g. Digital Cash by Finn Brunton
was with Princeton University Press, and MIT Press has titles on blockchain’s societal impact). If the
author has strong academic credibility or if the book has a policy angle, these presses could be a
backup plan. However, an MIT/Oxford Press book might not reach as “mainstream” an audience as,
say, Penguin or Hachette (Confidence: MEDIUM).
• Smaller presses / Indies – There are some specialized indie publishers like O’Reilly Media (famous
for tech books, but usually more technical manuals than narrative) or Melville House (which does
topical pamphlet-like books), or Columbia Global Reports (which does short books on global issues).
These could be options if larger publishers don’t bite, but their advances are smaller and distribution
narrower.
Given the scope – global stablecoin paradigm shift – a larger publisher is ideal to ensure robust
distribution (bookstores, international editions, libraries) and marketing muscle. A publisher that sees this
as a potentially groundbreaking, conversation-starting book will invest in publicity. For instance, if the book
can be positioned akin to Yuval Noah Harari’s works (big ideas, broad readership), someone like Penguin
Press or Harper might give it a big push. On the other hand, if the pitch is more practical or finance-
oriented, Wiley or McGraw-Hill could be approached; they often do finance titles and reach those readers
(McGraw-Hill published some personal finance and investing books that break out).
14Publisher fit also depends on the author’s platform and tone. If the author is an academic or NGO
expert, an imprint known for serious nonfiction (Basic Books, PublicAffairs, Princeton UP) might find that
credibility attractive. If the author is more of a journalist or entrepreneur with stories to tell, a mainstream
commercial imprint (like St. Martin’s or Portfolio) might be better.
It’s worth noting that some publishers have published similar works recently: for example, The Future of
Money by Eswar Prasad was with Harvard University Press in 2021 – a prestigious academic press, but that
limits trade reach. Our book aims at mainstream skeptics, so leaning trade is wiser. We can mention in a
proposal comp titles and their publishers. E.g., The Age of Cryptocurrency (St. Martin’s/Macmillan 2015) 84 and
Bitcoin Standard (Wiley 2018) 85 to show there’s precedent. But also highlight that no book yet has exactly
tackled stablecoins and human themes for general readers, which is our unique angle.
Confidence: HIGH that targeting a major trade imprint is the way to go. Those publishers have shown
interest in technology-meets-society books and have the editing/marketing expertise to refine the narrative
for a broad audience. An agent would likely pitch to multiple imprints at the Big 5 (PRH, Harper, Simon &
Schuster, Hachette, Macmillan) plus top independents (W.W. Norton, for example, is an indie that does a lot
of economics books and could be a dark horse candidate).
To summarize publisher fit: A book of this nature would fit well with a top-tier non-fiction imprint that handles
global economic trends or technology futures. Based on comps and publisher lists, PublicAffairs (Hachette)
and Portfolio (Penguin Random House) jump out as strong possibilities, with others like St. Martin’s
Press (Macmillan), Penguin Press, Basic Books (Hachette), or Norton also in play. We should tailor the
proposal submission list accordingly.
C2. Proposal Expectations in 2026
By 2026, the standard expectations for a nonfiction book proposal are well-established – and as a first-time
author, meeting them is crucial to secure a deal. A strong proposal is essentially a business case and
blueprint for the book 86 . Here’s what it needs to include (Confidence: HIGH, reflecting industry norms):
• Overview (Synopsis): A punchy opening section (2–5 pages) that answers “What is this book about,
and why does it matter now?” This is where we articulate the open question of the stablecoin
paradigm shift and why a mainstream reader will care. It should highlight the timely hook (e.g.
recent surge of digital currency debates, post-2008 trust issues, etc.) and the timeless significance
(money, trust, inclusion – human themes). In 2026, publishers expect the overview to also convey the
author’s voice and passion, not just the facts. This section must grab the editor’s attention much
like an article’s introduction. It’s also often where the “market positioning” is touched on: how this
book stands out from other finance/tech books and what problem or curiosity it addresses for
readers.
• Target Audience and Market: We need to clearly define who will buy and read this book. E.g. “This
book will appeal to readers of Yuval Noah Harari and Michael Lewis – educated laypeople who enjoy big
ideas wrapped in storytelling. It will also draw in cryptocurrency enthusiasts curious about stablecoins,
and skeptics of crypto looking for a balanced analysis.” Backing this up with some numbers or
demographics can help (e.g., number of crypto wallet users globally, or the strong sales of similar
titles showing market size). In 2026, proposals often mention the global market too – how the topic
15might play internationally (stablecoins are a global subject, which is a plus). Since the user is in New
Jersey but the topic is global, emphasize the broad relevance.
• Competition/Comparative Titles: Agents/editors expect a section analyzing 3–5 comparable books.
We should mention both recent and lasting comps: e.g., The Future of Money (Prasad, 2021), The Age
of Cryptocurrency (2015), Who Can You Trust? (2017), maybe The Bitcoin Standard (2018), etc. For each,
briefly note how our book is similar (topic interest) but also how it differs or fills a gap. Perhaps none
of those comps specifically addressed stablecoins’ human impact – that’s our niche. This section
shows we know the landscape and how to position our book uniquely. (It’s worth noting that
proposals typically avoid comps older than ~10 years unless they are still relevant, as an agent would
say older comps might be “out of print or dated” – but one can reference a classic if it makes sense)
87 .
• Author Bio & Platform: As a first-time author, platform is scrutinized. By 2026, publishers expect
nonfiction authors to demonstrate they can reach an audience or have authority. This means we
must highlight any relevant credentials (e.g., if the author is a fintech professional, economist,
journalist, etc.), and more importantly what reach do they have. Platform includes social media
following, newsletter subscribers, prior article publications, speaking engagements, or involvement
in communities. If the author has written op-eds or whitepapers on related topics, mention the
exposure. If not, it becomes important to show the author’s plan to build visibility (perhaps through
a blog, podcast interviews, etc.). The bio should also convey why the author is the right person to
write this: e.g., “X has spent a decade in the digital payments industry” or “Y is a researcher who
interviewed 100 people in 10 countries about money”. In 2026, given information saturation,
publishers particularly value authors who can promote the book themselves (Confidence: HIGH –
this has been a trend for years 88 89 ). If the author lacks a built-in audience, the proposal should
highlight any unique access or content they bring (like exclusive interviews or data for the book) to
reassure publishers the book will garner attention.
• Chapter Outline: A breakdown of the planned chapters, usually with a paragraph or two describing
each chapter’s content and purpose. This shows the book’s structure and that the author has a
coherent plan. For our stablecoin book, the outline might mirror the queries A1–A5 for some
chapters (e.g., a chapter on trust evolution, one on connected tech vs money, one on inclusion, etc.),
and then additional chapters painting scenarios of the future or policy debates. Each chapter blurb
should be engaging and not just “and then we’ll discuss X.” It should read like a teaser of the story/
argument of that chapter. For example, “Chapter 3: The Money That Isn’t There – This chapter explores
the billions of people cut off from traditional banking and how a smartphone and a stablecoin gave a
Kenyan shopkeeper the financial identity she never had. We examine whether digital dollars can succeed
where brick-and-mortar banks failed.” That kind of description both informs and intrigues. Typically,
editors like to see a logical progression – our outline should show a narrative arc or argumentative
flow, not just a grab-bag of topics.
• Sample Chapter(s): Most proposals include 1 or 2 sample chapters (or at least 15–30 pages of
sample material) 90 . As a first-time author, providing a polished sample is vital to prove we can
execute the writing. They will evaluate the prose, the clarity of explanation, and the storytelling. By
2026, with attention at a premium, a lively, well-edited sample chapter can clinch the deal. We should
choose a chapter that best showcases our style – often either the first chapter or a particularly
compelling case study chapter. Since our book will blend human stories with analysis, a sample that
16does both (maybe the opening anecdote of someone using a stablecoin in crisis followed by analysis)
could work well.
• Marketing & Promotion Plan (optional but increasingly common): Some proposals include a
section where the author outlines how they will help sell the book. As a first-timer, we should
demonstrate willingness and some concrete ideas: e.g., leveraging any industry contacts for bulk
sales or endorsements, a plan to do speaking engagements or webinars on the topic, reaching out
to podcasts or media where the author could appear (especially if the author has expertise or a
unique story that media would cover). While publishers don’t expect authors to do everything, by
2026 they certainly expect the author to be an active partner in promotion 88 . For instance, if the
author writes for a known blog or can get op-eds published around launch, mention that. If they
have relationships in the fintech community to tap into, note it.
• Length, Timeline, Deliverables: We should specify the anticipated manuscript length (perhaps
~80,000 words for a book like this, which is standard for serious nonfiction). Also note how quickly
after signing we can deliver the full manuscript – typically 6–12 months. Given it’s research-heavy,
maybe closer to 9 months. In 2026, publishers appreciate timely delivery especially if the topic is hot;
we might mention any work done so far (e.g., interviews completed, research compiled) to assure
them the project is manageable.
• Publication Considerations: Not always in the proposal, but an agent cover letter may mention if
the topic has global appeal for translation, etc. We can hint that “this topic’s global nature could attract
publishers in multiple markets – e.g., the UK, EU, and emerging economies where stablecoins are in use.”
That signals potential rights sales (which publishers love).
In summary, the proposal needs to prove two things: (1) There is an audience hungry for this book and it fills
a real gap/need, and (2) The author is capable of delivering a well-written, credible, and promotable book.
Specific data and sources we’ve gathered (like trust stats, unbanked numbers, etc.) can be peppered into
the proposal overview to show the timely evidence. For instance, writing “Stablecoins handled $8.5 trillion
on-chain in one quarter of 2024 – more than double Visa’s volume 43 , yet most people have barely heard of
them. This book demystifies this quiet revolution…” is the kind of punchy fact that excites editors
(Confidence: HIGH that using such facts is effective).
The publication date in a citation isn’t usually needed in the proposal text (we use it here for our research
verification), but we might mention recent events by year to show freshness (e.g., “As of 2026, nine of the
top ten banks are piloting some form of digital currency…” if true, hypothetically). The overall tone of the
proposal should be confident and authoritative, but also accessible – much like the book itself.
(Confidence: HIGH on these expectations, as they align with advice from publishing experts and Jane Friedman’s
guidelines 91 88 . There is little deviation in 2026 from these long-standing norms, though emphasis on author
platform continues to grow.)
C5. Self-Publishing vs. Traditional Publishing: Trade-offs for a Debut Author
Deciding between traditional publishing and self-publishing is a major consideration for a first-time author
in 2026. Each route has its pros and cons, and the best choice depends on the author’s goals, resources,
and appetite for the publishing process.
17Traditional Publishing Pros:
- Distribution and Exposure: A traditional publisher will get the book into brick-and-mortar bookstores,
libraries, and international markets more readily. They have sales teams with relationships to retailers. For a
global topic like stablecoins, having the book physically available in say, airport bookstores or prominent
placement at Barnes & Noble can significantly boost visibility. Also, translations and foreign rights deals are
often handled by the publisher’s rights team. It’s not unusual for a Big 5-published book to get picked up in
multiple languages if the topic has global interest (and stablecoins do). - Professional Editing and Design:
The publisher provides editing (developmental and copyediting), cover design, and formatting at no cost to
the author. This usually results in a more polished product. A strong cover and title can make a huge
difference in attracting readers; big publishers have experts for that. For example, the iconic orange cover
of The Bitcoin Standard by Wiley or the bold design of The Age of Cryptocurrency weren’t the authors’ doing –
it was the publisher’s design team (Confidence: HIGH – publishers invest in these elements to maximize
appeal). - Advance & Financial Support: Traditional deals often come with an advance payment against
royalties. For a first-timer, it might range widely (from maybe $10k up to six figures if the publisher is very
excited). An advance allows the author to focus on writing without financial strain. It’s essentially the
publisher betting on the book’s success. They also cover all production costs (editing, printing, etc.), which is
significant. - Legitimacy and Reviews: Being published by a reputable house often gives a stamp of
credibility. Mainstream media and award committees tend to take traditionally published books more
seriously (with exceptions). Many high-profile book reviewers (e.g. NY Times, Economist) review mostly
traditionally published books. Also, for academic or policy impact, a known publisher can carry weight. A
skeptical mainstream reader might also be more inclined to pick up a book from, say, Penguin Random
House versus an unknown imprint, assuming quality vetted (though this perception is slowly changing). -
Marketing and PR Support: This can vary widely, but at minimum publishers send out review copies, get
the book listed in catalogs, and sometimes pursue media coverage. The reality is they have limited budgets
and first-time authors may not get a big marketing push, but some support is there (catalog placement,
perhaps entry into relevant award contests, maybe organizing a launch event or inclusion in publisher
promotions). They may also handle or assist with distribution of eBook and audiobook versions.
Traditional Publishing Cons:
- Long Timeline: It’s typically slow. From proposal acceptance to publication can be 12–18 months
(sometimes more). In 2026, even with faster digital processes, big publishers often schedule books far in
advance. For a fast-evolving topic like crypto, this could mean some material risks becoming less cutting-
edge by release. If the author/publisher want the book out while stablecoins are a hot topic, they’d need to
push for an expedited schedule (which is possible, but usually at best maybe 9 months to a year). Self-
publishing can be done as soon as the book is finished – a huge time advantage if urgency is a factor. - Loss
of Control: With a publisher, the author signs over certain rights and control. The publisher often has final
say on the title, cover design, and marketing strategies. The author might prefer a certain title or cover
concept, but the publisher might veto it based on market research or sales input. Content-wise, editors will
influence structure and tone for marketability. Some authors find this guidance invaluable; others feel it
compromises their vision. For instance, a publisher might say “cut Chapter 5, it’s too technical for readers,”
whereas in self-pub the author could keep it. Also, pricing is set by the publisher; a first-time author can’t
dictate price or do free promotions at will. - Lower Royalty Rate: Typical royalties from traditional deals are
around 10–15% of hardcover net price, ~7–10% of trade paperback, and ~25% of net on e-books. In
contrast, self-published authors on Amazon Kindle get up to 70% of the sale price on e-books (for certain
price ranges), and typically around 40–60% on print-on-demand paperbacks. So if the book sells extremely
well, the author might eventually earn more per copy self-publishing. However, the trade-off is the advance:
in trad publishing, you keep the advance even if sales are modest. In self-pub, you earn nothing until
18readers find and buy the book. - Need for Agent: To get a good deal, the author usually needs a literary
agent, which is an extra step (and 15% commission of royalties). Finding an agent itself can be challenging
and time-consuming for a new author. It’s part of the process but not a guarantee – so there’s a gatekeeper
layer that doesn’t exist in self-publishing, where you can publish whatever you want whenever you’re ready.
Self-Publishing Pros:
- Speed to Market: The author can publish on their own timeline. If we wanted to capitalize on a particular
event or breakthrough (say a major stablecoin-related news cycle), we could release the book in a matter of
weeks after finishing manuscript. This agility is great for timely content. For example, when Terra stablecoin
collapsed in 2022, an indie author could have written a quick book on “Lessons from Terra’s Collapse” and
been on Amazon by fall 2022 – a traditional publisher’s book on it might only come out in 2023 or 2024. -
Creative Control: The author is the boss of all decisions – cover design, title, pricing, formats, marketing
strategies. This means the book can stay true to the author’s vision entirely. Also, niche content that a
publisher might trim (like technical appendices or detailed case studies) can be retained if the author
believes their readers want it. We could, for instance, include a full transcript of a fascinating interview in an
appendix without worrying about page count constraints from a publisher. - Higher Royalty Potential: As
noted, platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) offer ~70% royalties on e-books priced $2.99–
$9.99. Print on demand might give ~50% after printing costs. If the book sells in decent volume, the author
can earn substantially more per copy than the few dollars per copy via trad publishing. For a long-tail book
(steady small sales over time), self-pub can be financially rewarding. There are examples of self-published
nonfiction authors who built a following and made far more than they would have with a publisher
(especially if they also sell direct or do bulk sales to organizations). - Niche Targeting and Marketing
Flexibility: The author can tailor marketing to very specific audiences (like running ads on crypto forums, or
bundling the book with an online course, etc.). Self-pub authors can also update the book easily – a big plus
for a fast-moving field. If next year a new development in stablecoins occurs, a self-pub author can release a
revised edition or add a chapter and re-upload it. Traditional reprints/editions take longer and might not
happen unless sales justify. - Ownership of Rights: The author keeps all rights (unless they sign them to
someone for distribution). This means they can negotiate film/TV or audiobook independently, license
translations directly, or do special editions. With a publisher, those rights are typically theirs to exploit (they
give some share to author, but they control the deals largely).
Self-Publishing Cons:
- Discoverability & Credibility Challenges: The biggest challenge is getting readers. Without a publisher’s
platform, a first-time author must build their own buzz. The book might not be reviewed by major outlets
(though some self-pub books have broken through, it’s rare). It won’t automatically be in physical stores
(though one can get into Amazon and maybe Barnes & Noble online; physical B&N or libraries require
special effort and often prefer trad-pub books). There’s also still some stigma or skepticism among certain
readers (“is a self-published book as reliable?”). However, this stigma is lessening year by year as more
quality self-published works emerge. - Upfront Costs & Effort: The author must either learn to do or pay
for all the services a publisher would provide – professional editing (highly recommended, and costs can be
several thousand dollars), cover design (a good cover designer might charge a thousand or two),
formatting, etc. Skimping on these can hurt the book’s quality. So there’s a financial investment required.
Marketing is also entirely on the author’s shoulders – running ads, sending press releases, organizing book
talks, etc. This can be time-consuming and requires a skill set (or hiring a publicist). Many successful self-
pub authors effectively become entrepreneurs running a small publishing business for their book. - No
Advance, Uncertain Income: You might invest money and time and see minimal sales – there’s no advance
safety net. It could take months or years to recoup costs, if ever. Traditional at least gives some money
19upfront and the validation of a contract. - Market Saturation: By 2026, self-publishing is very popular,
meaning millions of titles are out there on Amazon and other platforms. Standing out in that sea is tough. If
one doesn’t hit best-seller lists or have a hook for media coverage, the book can languish. Traditional
publishers have the advantage of visibility in curated spaces (bookstores, media coverage that often ignores
indie books, etc.).
Hybrid Approaches: It’s worth noting the existence of hybrid publishing and also the ability to do both
(some authors self-publish first to build a following, then get a traditional deal later). For instance, one
strategy could be self-publish an e-book original to test the market, then use its success to pitch a
traditional edition. But for a complex book with global scope, that might not be ideal – better to aim high
with traditional from the start, unless time-to-market is absolutely critical.
For this project, since it aims to influence mainstream conversations and policy thinking, traditional
publishing likely offers a better platform. The credibility and distribution could ensure the book finds its
way to journalists, policymakers, and skeptics who might not otherwise pick it up. On the other hand, if no
publisher buys the proposal or if the author values control and has a strong marketing plan of their own
(say, a huge online following or organizational support), self-publishing could be a viable Plan B.
It’s also a personality fit issue: do you as an author want to navigate corporate publishing processes, or do
you prefer the entrepreneurial route of self-pub? Some authors relish the DIY approach; others prefer to
focus on writing and let professionals handle the rest.
In conclusion, the trade-off comes down to reach vs. control/royalties. Traditional can amplify reach and
prestige, crucial for a book trying to shape public discourse (Confidence: HIGH – historically, traditionally
published works have an easier time in mainstream discourse). Self-publishing grants control and
potentially more profit per sale, but requires the author to be marketer and publisher as well, with the risk
of limited reach if not executed well (Confidence: HIGH given the known difficulties).
For a first-time nonfiction author with a topic as significant as the global stablecoin shift, a prudent path
might be: try traditional publishing first (to leverage its advantages), but be prepared to pivot to self-pub if the
industry gatekeepers don’t recognize the book’s potential or if speed becomes paramount. Each route has
success stories and cautionary tales, so the author should weigh these factors against their own situation
and objectives.
Key Findings & Sources:
• Human Themes (2005–2026): Trust in institutions declined globally since 2005 1 , majority now
default to distrust 2 . Rise of insularity/nationalism documented by Edelman 2026 (70% unwilling to
trust those with different views) 4 . Economic grievances high – 60% say system favors the rich 7 .
Social media connected 64% of world by 2025 8 . Work went remote (Zoom jump from 10M to
300M users in 2020) 9 . Only 15% in developed nations are optimistic about next generation’s
future 12 . (Confidence: HIGH, multi-source agreement).
• Trust Evolution (2008–2026): U.S. confidence in banks fell from 41% (2007) to 22% (2009) post-crisis
16 , never fully recovered (38% in 2020) 16 . Global trust in government/institutions steadily eroding
201 – people trust local circles more 18 . Gallup 2022: trust in financial firms ranges 4% (Lebanon) to
95% (Kuwait) 25 , showing link between stability and trust. Bitcoin’s birth in 2009 signaled a response
to broken trust (genesis block referenced bank bailout) 19 . (Confidence: HIGH, strong data trends).
• Connected vs Money Lag: Social networks and e-commerce globalized (e.g. $6.42T e-commerce in
2025, 20.5% of retail) 33 . Cross-border money transfer still costly – ~6.5% fees on average in 2025
35 , vs <1% domestic 37 . Cross-border payments “not kept up” with domestic innovation 38 .
Stablecoins show potential: $8.5T on-chain volume in one quarter 2024 (2× Visa) 43 , but mostly not
retail use (only 5% real economy transactions) 42 . (Confidence: HIGH, clear quantitative evidence).
• Financial Exclusion & Dignity: 1.4B adults unbanked + 400M underserved 44 . Exclusion traps
communities in poverty 48 . Fintech leaders frame inclusion as restoring dignity/opportunity 49 55 .
Stablecoins give lifeline in unstable economies – seen in Argentina, Venezuela usage (USDT, USDC at
stores). 13% of U.S. unbanked cite lack of trust in banks 51 , showing human dimension of opting
out. (Confidence: HIGH, widely corroborated by World Bank and fintech case studies).
• Nature of Money & Stablecoins: Money’s form is changing – “The nature of money is changing…
financial system remains outdated” 45 . Stablecoins enable instant, 24/7, borderless transactions
59 , a fundamental shift in flow. Yet money’s essence as credit/trust persists 58 . Centralized
stablecoins keep trust in issuer (no big behavioral change), but decentralized forms alter trust
models (trust in code/community). Digital money could increase surveillance – concerns that
stablecoin laws must ensure privacy 60 . Books/papers note programmable money’s pros and cons
(efficiency vs. autonomy). (Confidence: MEDIUM, as forward-looking implications are debated, but
early trends/backlash are documented).
• Comp Titles Lasting vs Dated: The Sovereign Individual (1997) predicted digital currency, still cited
(authors Davidson/Rees-Mogg). The Ascent of Money (2008) timeless due to historical span. The World
Is Flat (2005) now feels dated in parts (missed later issues). Age of Cryptocurrency (2015) and Digital
Gold (2015) provide history but lack latest developments. Who Can You Trust? (2017, Botsman)
remains relevant on trust shift (publication by PublicAffairs). Bitcoin Standard (2018, Wiley) became a
crypto classic (ideological stance keeps niche appeal). Lesson: broad vision and fundamental
questions yield longevity; trend-chasing books age quickly 68 . (Confidence: HIGH, evidenced by
continued references or absence thereof in discourse).
• Naming Conventions: Two-part titles standard – catchy phrase + explanatory subtitle 66 75 .
Common patterns: “The [Noun] of [Big Concept]”, “How [X] is [Changing] [Y]”, or provocative
questions. Examples: Bitcoin: The Future of Money? 70 , The Age of Cryptocurrency: How Bitcoin… 66 ,
The Curse of Cash 75 , Who Can You Trust? Titles often use metaphors (Digital Gold), power words
(Revolution, Future, Rise, New). For subtitles, clarity on stablecoins and stakes is key (e.g. “…and the
Future of Finance” or “…the Fight for Financial Access”). (Confidence: HIGH, aligned with many
nonfiction bestsellers’ titles).
• Proposal Requirements: Typically ~20–30 pages plus sample chapters 91 . Should include overview
of concept (with a compelling hook), target audience, competitive analysis, author credentials/
platform, chapter outline, and sample material. Emphasis in 2026 on why now (timeliness) and why
you (author authority and reach) 88 92 . Solid proposals address marketability upfront – “why this
21book will sell and how it’s different”. Given first-time status, a polished sample chapter is crucial to
demonstrate writing skill. (Confidence: HIGH, per publishing guides and agent feedback).
• Traditional vs Self-Publishing Trade-offs: Traditional brings professional editing, design, broader
distribution (bookstores, libraries), and a credibility boost, at cost of lower royalties (~10–15% vs up
to 70% self-pub) and creative control (publisher has final say on many aspects) 74 . It’s slower (often
12–18 months to release) but can reach more readers through established channels. Self-publishing
offers speed (publish as soon as ready), control (author decides everything), and higher share per
sale, but requires author to handle all production and marketing tasks/costs and fight for
discoverability in a crowded market. Many self-published books struggle to match the reach of a
traditionally published title, especially in nonfiction thought-leadership space (major media still
skews toward traditionally published authors). However, niche audience targeting and iterative
updates are advantages self-pub has. (Confidence: HIGH, as these points are well documented in
publishing industry analysis).
Surprises and Noteworthy Points: A few findings were particularly surprising or counter-intuitive: -
Stablecoins’ transaction volume – the fact that in Q2 2024 stablecoins did over $8 trillion in volume,
double that of Visa 43 , is striking. It underlines their rapid rise in utility, yet public awareness is relatively
low. A tech insider might not realize just how much these are used under the hood already (mostly in crypto
trading and certain remittances). This scale makes stablecoins hard to ignore going forward. -
Pervasiveness of distrust – it’s notable that only 1 in 3 people globally default to trusting others 2 . In
hindsight this era might be seen as a peak of distrust and polarization. A mainstream skeptic likely feels this
anecdotally, but seeing it quantified (70% in insular mindsets) 4 is eye-opening. Also surprising is how
workplaces have emerged as relatively trusted arenas compared to society at large 93 – something we
might incorporate in the book when discussing who steps up to broker trust (like employers, per Edelman).
- Financial inclusion framed as a basic need – the language of dignity and rights around finance has
become stronger. The LinkedIn piece explicitly connecting fintech to human dignity 49 is a shift from a
decade ago when inclusion was talked about more in economic terms only. It highlights a moral dimension:
exclusion isn’t just inconvenient, it’s unjust. - Generational trust gap – younger generations trust
institutions even less 23 . By 2050, looking back, this might be obvious (“those who grew up post-2008
never developed trust in banks or government like earlier cohorts did”). But it’s important now for our
narrative – it suggests any solution (like new forms of money) might find readier adoption among youth
disillusioned with legacy systems. - Book publishing insight: Perhaps surprising to the user could be how
much a proposal can matter more than a full manuscript for nonfiction. The idea that we sell the concept
and ourselves before writing the book fully (with only sample chapters) 94 might be new to those outside
publishing. It emphasizes planning and market savvy. Also the notion that “the artfulness of the writing
doesn’t matter as much as the marketability” for many nonfiction categories 88 can be a sobering surprise
– it means as authors we must think like publishers in crafting the concept.
All these findings and reflections will inform both the content of the book and how we present it to the
market, ensuring it’s compelling, credible, and impactful for years to come.
