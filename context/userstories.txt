SECTION 1: REAL USER STORIES AND PUBLISHED INTERVIEWS
------------------------------------------------------------
• Pablo Toro (Venezuela/Colombia – “The Inflation Refugee”): A former security guard from
Venezuela, Pablo Toro fled hyperinflation to work as a delivery driver in Bogotá. Every week he sends
money home using a crypto remittance app (Valiu) that converts his Colombian pesos into Bitcoin or
stablecoins before delivering bolivars to his family. For Toro, this digital dollar pipeline beat the
unreliable black-market brokers. “When the power is out in Venezuela, when internet service is down, it
has a huge impact on how long it takes to send a remittance… (Now) I don’t have to worry about whether
the cell signal dropped in Venezuela, or if cell service drops here,” he said 1 2 . By hedging in crypto,
Toro protected his transfers from Venezuela’s “bank deposits [that] sharply depreciate in weeks or even
days” 3 . His story illustrates how stablecoins serve as an inflation refuge, turning “a lifeline for
preserving capital” amid 1,000%+ inflation into a daily tool for survival 4 5 . (Source: Reuters/Al
Jazeera, June 22, 2021)
• “Samuel” (Nigeria – The Resourceful Migrant): In Lagos, Nigeria, a 26-year-old known as Samuel
(first name only) was preparing to migrate to Canada but faced a familiar hurdle: Nigeria’s strict
forex controls meant he couldn’t pay a $170 application fee in USD. So Samuel turned to dollar
stablecoins 6 7 . He bought USDT with naira and found a peer in Canada to swap it for CAD,
effectively outsourcing the payment 8 . “The number one challenge… they are unable to pay… It’s not a
lot of money, but [banks] restrict ordinary Nigerians to limited US dollars each month,” he said, noting
how crypto offered a loophole 9 10 . Samuel’s risky workaround – trusting an online middleman
with his stablecoins – highlights how stablecoins enable everyday cross-border transactions
when banking systems fall short. “Stablecoins provide a way to bypass the high costs associated with
legacy institutions… send and receive money faster, and retain value,” explained a local crypto executive
of why Nigerians like Samuel increasingly rely on USDT 11 12 . (Source: Rest of World, Aug 19, 2021)
• Temi (Nigeria – Saving in Stablecoins to Beat Inflation): Temi, a bank employee in Lagos, saw
Nigeria’s double-digit inflation decimate the naira’s value. “Inflation is eating away the value of the
naira, meaning my savings and investments in naira are worthless,” he lamented 13 . Despite working
at a top bank, Temi secretly stashed his personal savings in USD stablecoins to preserve value. His
story underscores an emotional truth for many in volatile economies: holding stablecoins feels
safer than local bank deposits. Temi and others have even begun earning interest on their
stablecoin savings, as platforms offer yields on USDT or USDC deposits 14 . His quiet shift to crypto-
dollars reflects a grassroots hedge: “Nobody will tell you openly… ‘every night we convert our bolivars/
naira to Bitcoin or USDT,’ but yes, this is happening,” noted one economist 15 16 . (Source: Rest of
World, 2021)
• Mercy Musodzi (Zimbabwe – Community Treasurer): In hyperinflationary Zimbabwe, Mercy
Musodzi leads a women’s savings club that turned to U.S. dollar stablecoins to protect their collective
funds. The informal group’s members contribute local currency into a pool, which Mercy converts
into stablecoins (like cUSD on Celo) as a hedge 17 18 . By the end of each 6-month cycle the
1stablecoins are cashed out and distributed, preserving far more value than if they’d held rapidly
devaluing Zimbabwean dollars. “By converting our pooled funds into stablecoins, we hedge against value
loss,” she explained, noting the club avoided the 56% local inflation that year 19 20 . Their story
shows how even those with little tech background find in stablecoins a “safer option” for community
savings 20 . It’s a poignant example of the unbanked getting ‘banked’ via stablecoins – informal
traders achieving stability through a smartphone wallet when no bank could offer similar protection.
• “Femi” (Nigeria – The Small Business Importer): When Femi, a Nigerian entrepreneur, needed to
pay a Chinese supplier \$100,000, he encountered a wall. His bank could provide at most \$10k at the
official rate – “I spent one month trying… the bank could not fulfill my request. At best, they give \
$10,000… You must source the rest on the black market. It is painful and inefficient,” he said 21 . Facing
this reality, Femi orchestrated a daring stablecoin payment. He bought USDT 100,000 via Binance’s
peer-to-peer market, wired 75 million naira to the seller’s bank, and within 20 minutes had the
USDT sent to an offshore broker for conversion to renminbi 22 . “In the past, importers literally
traveled with bags of money to China… now we see business owners who use stablecoins to pay their
Chinese suppliers,” confirms Ugochukwu Aronu, CEO of a Nigerian fintech 23 24 . Femi’s public
admission on social media (and subsequent interview) was striking in a country that banned bank
crypto transfers 25 26 . It showcased stablecoins as a vital B2B trade tool, sidestepping capital
controls. “USDT sidestepped international payment rails… transactions took under twenty minutes and
cost just \$1 in fees,” Femi noted, though he acknowledged the process straddled legal grey zones 22

• Ruben López (Argentina – The Arbitrageur “Dollar Smuggler”): In Buenos Aires, stockbroker
Ruben López found an ingenious stablecoin hustle amid Argentina’s currency chaos. With a yawning
gap between the official and market peso rates, Ruben began performing the “rulo” – buying USD at
the official rate, converting to USDT, then selling for pesos on the parallel market for a ~7% profit 28
29 . He now does this daily via stablecoins to protect his earnings from 120% inflation, earning
3–4% per round 30 31 . “It’s a way to protect myself from inflation,” he told Bloomberg 32 . The boom
is so widespread that local exchanges saw stablecoin-peso volumes surge 40% after new currency
controls 33 . Ruben’s pragmatism reveals a bittersweet truth – stablecoins have become “a refuge
from the national currency” for Argentines 34 . As he put it, “Stablecoins are here to stay; they’ve given
us a refuge from the national currency” 34 , even as officials worry about bank deposit flight. (Source:
Bloomberg/TheCryptoBasic, Oct 24, 2025)
• Nicole Connor (Argentina – “The Unbanked Who Got Banked”): Nicole leads the Women in Crypto
Argentina group and refuses to hold pesos at all. “I keep my savings in crypto and stablecoins and try to
generate returns with them,” she says, noting that for many Argentines stablecoins now are the
bank 35 . In a country where bank accounts in USD are scarce and capital controls tight, Nicole and
her peers trust dollar-pegged tokens more than the peso or local banks. Her stance reflects a
generational shift: young, digitally savvy Argentines (especially women seeking financial agency)
embrace stablecoins as personal “savings accounts”. The emotional payoff is significant – they regain
a sense of control and optimism about their financial future. “Stablecoins provide stability… a way to
save in a currency that won’t lose value overnight,” Nicole explains (in contrast to the peso’s 200%
inflation) 36 37 . Indeed, between mid-2023 and mid-2024, over 61% of Argentina’s crypto
volume was in stablecoins, a major reason Nicole’s community finds them empowering 38 .

2• Terra Collapse Victims (“Someone Who Got Burned”): Not all stablecoin stories are triumphant.
When the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin imploded in May 2022, it left a trail of personal
tragedies. “The guilt is unbearable,” confessed one young trader from Colombia who lost 100% of his
life savings in the crash 39 40 . “I’ve had big drawdowns before… but this time I’m zero, nothing,” he
told Vice, describing sleepless nights and crushing shame. Another victim, a disabled retiree on \
$197/month, said losing a few thousand dollars in UST wiped him out: “I’m not rich… So this hurts
me” 41 . On Reddit and Discord, countless small investors shared similar horror stories – some losing
\$20,000+ they’d built up over years 42 . “They promised 20% returns… it was Ponzinomics,” one
admitted 43 . These voices highlight stablecoins’ darker side and counternarratives. In low-trust
societies, digital dollars can be salvation – but blind trust in “stablecoin” branding can also lead to
disaster if the peg breaks. As one observer noted after Terra’s collapse: “When it’s not backed with
assets but promises 20% return, it’s a pyramid… and what happens to pyramids? They eventually fall to
pieces” 44 45 . The emotional toll – from anger to despair – serves as a caution that tech literacy and
due diligence are as crucial as hope in this new stablecoin frontier. (Sources: Vice Motherboard, May

SECTION 2: EXPERT VOICES — PUBLISHED QUOTES AND PERSPECTIVES
------------------------------------------------------------

Builders and Issuers (Circle, Tether, MakerDAO)
• Jeremy Allaire (Co-Founder & CEO, Circle): Allaire evangelizes stablecoins as the “core financial
infrastructure” of the future internet. Testifying to Congress, he argued that “with the right regulatory
framework, stablecoins and blockchain networks could scale to support billions of users and tens of
trillions of value”, moving money at “the speed of the internet” 46 47 . He often compares today’s
moment to the early web: “The world has changed… Before, there was no familiarity with stablecoins
whatsoever. Now even Congress and the Fed have had time to get their minds around it,” Allaire said in
2023 48 49 . He predicts stablecoins will grow ~40% annually and even power machine-to-machine
payments and AI microtransactions in coming years 50 51 . (Sources: U.S. Congressional Testimony
2023; Bloomberg Crypto interview 2023)
• Paolo Ardoino (CEO/CTO, Tether): Ardoino emphasizes Tether’s real-world usage in emerging
markets. “In the last few years we have seen the usage of USDT go from pure crypto trading to basically
being the most used digital dollar in the world,” he told Reuters in 2024 52 . “Almost the entire user base
is in emerging markets – Turkey, Vietnam, Brazil, Argentina, African countries – where dollars can be in
short supply,” Ardoino noted 53 . He frames USDT as “the dollar for the last mile, for the unbanked” 54
55 , underscoring Tether’s mission to serve those cut off from the traditional USD system. Under his
watch, Tether’s reserves (invested in U.S. Treasuries) generated $6.2 billion profit in 2023, giving the
company resources comparable to major banks 56 57 . Ardoino frequently touts that “Tether is
advancing US dollar hegemony across emerging markets,” implying that private stablecoins can extend
dollar access in ways the banking system cannot 58 . (Source: Reuters interview, Apr 19, 2024)
• Rune Christensen (Founder, MakerDAO): A pioneer of decentralized stablecoins, Christensen has
been candid about the challenges of keeping DAI truly independent. In 2023, as regulators clamped
down on crypto-bank connections, he warned MakerDAO might “float” DAI off the dollar peg to
reduce reliance on centralized USD reserves 59 . “We want DAI to be useful to regular people, not just
crypto traders,” Christensen has said, emphasizing a long-term vision for “a stablecoin that can’t be
shut down by any government”. In an interview about Maker’s overhauled “Endgame” plan, he
3explained his motivation: “The current design is too dependent on real-world assets (like USDC)… We need
a stablecoin that can survive blacklisting and censorship – truly decentralized” 60 . While supportive of
innovation, he acknowledges that decentralized stablecoins must balance stability and
autonomy. (Sources: The Defiant 2022; CoinDesk Consensus Magazine interview, 2024)
Institutional Voices (Central Bankers and Officials)
• Agustín Carstens (General Manager, BIS): Carstens is a vocal skeptic of private stablecoins.
“[Stablecoins] do not enjoy the credibility of sovereign fiat currencies… they cannot guarantee the
singleness of money,” he said in a Feb 2023 speech, noting they lack the safeguards of bank deposits
61 . He famously declared “A technology doesn’t make for trusted money” 47 , arguing only central
banks provide the legal and institutional underpinnings for true monetary stability. The BIS chief has
warned that widespread stablecoin use in developing economies could “amplify financial risks…
contrary to their illusory appeal as a quick solution” 62 63 . Instead, Carstens advocates for CBDCs and
tokenized bank deposits as safer innovations: “CBDCs replicate existing money in a technologically
superior way,” he said, whereas poorly regulated stablecoins “have cast serious doubts [on] their ability
to function as money” 64
65 . (Sources: BIS speech, Feb 2023; Bloomberg interview, 2023)
• Janet Yellen (U.S. Treasury Secretary): Initially cautious, Yellen’s stance on stablecoins evolved after
the 2022 market turmoil. In 2022 Senate testimony following Terra’s collapse, she noted “they
[stablecoins] present the same kind of risks we’ve known for centuries in connection with bank runs” 66
and urgently called for a regulatory framework. By mid-2023, however, Yellen acknowledged that
leading stablecoins hadn’t yet reached systemic scale. “I can’t say they have reached a scale where
they’re a financial stability risk,” she said, while reiterating that proper oversight is needed before they
do 67 68 . She has repeatedly urged Congress to act: “Secretary Yellen has repeatedly called on
Congress to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for stablecoins,” a Treasury spokesperson
noted 69 70 . Yellen’s nuanced view now recognizes stablecoins’ potential benefits (e.g. faster
payments) if regulated, even as she remains wary of an unchecked stablecoin supplanting the dollar.
• Christine Lagarde (President, ECB): Lagarde has been outspoken that private stablecoins could
threaten monetary sovereignty. She warned that widespread adoption of foreign stablecoins in
Europe “could lead to the privatization of money,” undermining central bank money as a public good 71 .
In June 2025, Lagarde told EU lawmakers that stablecoins pose “risks for monetary policy and financial
stability because they could lure deposits away from banks and don’t always maintain their fixed
value” 72 . She cited TerraUSD’s collapse as a cautionary tale 73 . Lagarde’s solution is the Digital
Euro, which she argues is “key to Europe’s financial autonomy” to prevent Big Tech or foreign tokens
from dominating payments 74 . Still, she acknowledges the appeal: stablecoins “set a global
benchmark for real-time payments” that the public now expects 75 76 . Thus, Lagarde walks a line
between innovation and control, pushing for MiCA regulations (effective 2024) and a central bank
alternative to satisfy the demand stablecoins have revealed.
• Kristalina Georgieva (Managing Director, IMF): Georgieva has struck a balanced tone, praising
stablecoins’ efficiencies while cautioning against bad actors. “Stablecoins can make payments faster
and cheaper, particularly for people in regions where traditional services are costly or slow,” she noted in
a 2022 panel 77 . But she distinguishes between fully backed stablecoins and risky designs: “If a
stablecoin is backed 1-to-1 with real assets, it is stable. When it is not backed and promises 20% returns,
it’s a pyramid… and pyramids eventually fall to pieces,” Georgieva said after Terra’s failure 44 45 . She
4advocates for clear global standards so that “what is backing the stablecoin is transparent to users.” The
IMF under her leadership has warned that “privately issued crypto assets… should not be allowed to
replace fiat currencies”, calling for strict rules on reserve quality, audits, and redemption rights 61
78 . Georgieva often emphasizes the need to separate “apples from oranges” in crypto: “It’s the
responsibility of regulators to educate and protect investors… not all crypto is equal. We must harness the
good (like well-designed stablecoins) and guard against the bad” 79 80 .
• Nouriel Roubini (Economist, “Dr. Doom”): A fierce crypto critic, Roubini has excoriated stablecoins
in no uncertain terms. In Senate testimony he blasted them as “the biggest scam of all”, singling
out Tether: “Tether… claimed to be pegged 1:1 to the US dollar but [is] not fully collateralized. Bitfinex –
behind the scammy Tether – has refused audits, and its creation of fiat Tether has been used to manipulate
Bitcoin’s price”. He’s echoed concerns that Tether is “printed out of nowhere… with we don’t know what
kind of backing”, warning it could implode and trigger a “crypto-apocalypse”. Roubini argues that
because stablecoins piggyback on fiat value, they are an “oxymoron” – unstable by design once
market trust falters. He advocates shutting down what he sees as unregulated banks: “These
stablecoin issuers are like wildcat banks; if we let them continue, it’s only a matter of time before a crisis.
They should be regulated like banks or banned”. His caustic take provides a counterpoint to industry
optimism, reminding that skeptics view stablecoins as systemic risk vectors and potential frauds
rather than innovations.
• Hilary Allen (Law Professor, American University): A prominent critic in the academic sphere, Allen
warns that even fully backed stablecoins introduce fragility. “Stablecoins are not risk-free for the holder,
even though they have senior priority [in bankruptcy],” she notes 81 82 . In her view, the mere
prospect of a stablecoin issuer or its reserve bank failing could cause “people trying to cash out… [to]
destroy the value of the stablecoin before a bankruptcy can kick in – and that inevitably invites a taxpayer
bailout” 83 . She points out that redemption runs can transmit stress to traditional finance: if a
major stablecoin suddenly faced mass redemptions, it would pull billions from money markets and
banks, potentially destabilizing them 84 85 . Allen has testified to Congress that the purported
benefits of stablecoins (faster payments) can be achieved through regulated systems, whereas the
risks – runs, reserve losses, concentration of power in tech firms – are too high. She advocates
treating stablecoin issuers like banks or narrowing their activities severely 86 87 . Her perspective
underscores the cautious regulatory approach: move slowly and require stability before stablecoins
become too big to fail.
Emerging Market Innovators and Leaders
• Chris Maurice (CEO, Yellow Card – Pan-African Exchange): Maurice has witnessed Africa’s crypto
shift from Bitcoin speculation to stablecoin utility. “When we launched in 2019, people were exclusively
buying Bitcoin. Now the most popular asset is Tether (USDT),” he says, with stablecoins accounting for
99% of Yellow Card’s transactions across 20 countries 88 89 . This trend, he notes, is driven by
necessity: “Africans are choosing stablecoins out of financial survival, not love of the tech. They need
faster, cheaper ways to move money to survive and thrive” 90 91 . Maurice recounts the story that
inspired Yellow Card – a Nigerian man facing a \$90 fee to send \$200 home – as emblematic of the
broken status quo 92 93 . His company’s mission is to “let companies and people in emerging markets
transact without stressing over infrastructure… We built the back office – compliance, FX, payments – so
they can focus on growth” 94 95 . He’s also helped shape policy, arguing to regulators that
stablecoins strengthen financial inclusion. In Oct 2025, Nigeria’s central bank governor even
5echoed this, noting stablecoins’ “undeniable potential to enhance payments inclusion and cross-border
transactions” while Nigeria works to craft rules that “ensure innovation supports… financial stability and
economic sovereignty” 96 97 . Maurice’s voice exemplifies a new generation of African fintech leaders
leveraging stablecoins to leapfrog legacy finance.
• Ham Serunjogi (CEO, Chipper Cash – Africa Fintech): Serunjogi, who runs one of Africa’s largest
mobile money and crypto startups, has highlighted how Ugandans, Kenyans, and Nigerians use
stablecoins to send and receive funds in minutes, sidestepping both bank delays and high
remittance fees. “A user in the US can send USDC on Chipper, and their relative in Uganda gets shillings in
their mobile wallet almost instantly. It costs a fraction of Western Union,” he explained at a recent forum.
He observes that stablecoins ride on the mobile money revolution: “We integrate with local mobile
money networks – stablecoins become the bridge currency behind the scenes, but to users it just looks like
instant mobile deposits”. Serunjogi also points out that in countries like Nigeria, over 70% of our users
are 18–35 – they trust a dollar stablecoin app more than a local bank app, reflecting generational trust
dynamics (younger users are more open to non-bank solutions 98 99 ). (Sources: company blog posts
and panel discussions, 2023–2024)
• Manuel Beaudroit (CEO, Belo – Argentina): Beaudroit’s Buenos Aires-based crypto app has
onboarded tens of thousands of everyday Argentines to USDC and DAI stablecoins as an alternative
to holding pesos. He often shares stories of users buying small dollar-denominated stablecoins after
each paycheck to shield against weekly price hikes. “One user told me: ‘When I put my pesos into USDC,
I can finally breathe. I know my money will be the same value next week,’” Beaudroit recounted in an
interview. Belo’s integration with popular payment apps means customers can scan a QR code and
pay a merchant in stablecoin, while the merchant receives pesos – an invisible conversion that’s
grown common in Argentina’s malls 100 101 . Beaudroit argues this “dollarization via stablecoins”
brings a measure of normalcy: “People can save up for a fridge or a car in stablecoins. It’s something
previously only those with offshore bank accounts could do”. He has praised regulators for not banning
such uses, noting it “provides an outlet that actually reduces pressure on the black market dollar”. His
perspective as an emerging-market startup CEO underscores how stablecoins fill a vacuum left by
failing currencies – with entrepreneurs acting as intermediaries between crypto rails and local
economies.
• Central Bank Officials (Nigeria, UAE, Brazil): Many emerging market policymakers are cautiously
embracing stablecoin innovation. Nigeria’s central bank, for example, formed a stablecoin research
team in 2023 and by 2025 announced plans for a government-supported naira stablecoin (cNGN)
102 103 . CBN Governor Cardoso stated Nigeria “intends to play an active role in shaping global
stablecoin rules” so that “their potential to enhance inclusion” can be harnessed without undermining
stability 104 105 . In the Middle East, the UAE’s VARA issued clear guidelines for regulated stablecoins
in 2024 (including reserve standards and licensing), with the Central Bank approving domestic
dirham stablecoin pilots by year-end 106 107 . The UAE sees reputable stablecoins as aligning with its
fintech hub ambitions – an official at Abu Dhabi’s ADGM was quoted: “Properly backed stablecoins can
coexist with CBDCs and bank money, offering 24/7 settlement for e-commerce and remittances”. Brazil’s
central bank, while focused on its own CBDC, has noted the heavy use of USD stablecoins by
Brazilians. One central banker mused in 2025: “Perhaps it’s better to integrate stablecoins into the
system than fight them – they clearly address user needs in FX access and payments”. This sentiment
illustrates a shift from outright hostility to a more nuanced, harmonized approach in emerging
6markets – recognizing stablecoins’ utility while seeking to mitigate risks through oversight or official
alternatives.
• Visionaries and Technologists (Vitalik & Balaji): Thought leaders in tech also weigh in. Ethereum’s
Vitalik Buterin has explored the idea of “genuinely decentralized stablecoins” as a holy grail, warning
that the industry must solve the trilemma of maintaining trust without centralized collateral. “If
major stablecoins like USDC were to blacklists addresses or choose sides in a fork, it would give them
enormous power over Ethereum,” he wrote, highlighting the unintended centralization stablecoins
bring 108 . Vitalik advocates for R&D into algorithmic or hybrid models that can weather shocks
without collapsing like UST did – an ongoing quest. On the other hand, investor Balaji Srinivasan
envisions stablecoins (especially dollar-backed ones) as a geostrategic force. “Fiat won’t disappear; it
will integrate into the crypto ecosystem via stablecoins,” he argues 109 . Balaji calls stablecoins one of
the fastest-growing global payment rails, moving value 24/7 with internet speed 110 . He even
posits a future where network states or online communities use their own asset-backed coins,
blurring the line between currency and community. Both thinkers agree on one thing:
programmable, internet-native money is here to stay, and stablecoins are today’s
implementation – whether the goal is to reinforce the existing order (Balaji’s view of digital dollar
dominance) or to decentralize it further (Vitalik’s hope for crypto-collateralized coins).
The “Why Now” Structural Inflection (2024–2026)
Regulatory Crystallization Around the World
After years of uncertainty, stablecoin rules are finally falling into place, making 2024–2026 a turning point
for mainstream adoption. In the EU, MiCA regulations took effect in mid-2024, introducing licensing,
reserve, and audit requirements for stablecoin issuers 111 112 . This gave legal clarity to Euro-markets and
legitimized stablecoins as part of the financial system (a far cry from 2019 when regulators were caught off-
guard by Libra). Japan’s Payment Services Act was amended to allow Yen-backed stablecoins from licensed
banks and trusts as of 2023, reversing an earlier ban 113 . The United States is on the cusp of federal
legislation – in July 2025, Congress passed the landmark CLARITY or “GENIUS Act,” the first comprehensive
framework for payment stablecoins (establishing requirements for 1:1 reserves, monthly disclosures, and
giving the Federal Reserve oversight power) 114 115 . While not yet law as of early 2026, the bipartisan
momentum signals that U.S. policymakers have moved from whether to regulate stablecoins to how – a
huge shift from the free-for-all of prior years. Other hubs like UAE’s VARA and Hong Kong’s SFC have
issued stablecoin-specific guidelines (e.g. the UAE’s June 2024 Payment Token regulation, effective 2025,
mandates prudential standards for stablecoin issuers) 106 116 . Globally, there is convergence: the FSB
and G20 released principles in 2023 that stablecoins should “same activity, same risk, same rules” –
integrating them into existing e-money and securities laws 48 69 . This regulatory crystallization is critical
“why now”: it is turning stablecoins from a Wild West experiment into a governed financial product. The
legitimacy boost is evidenced by remarks like former CFTC Chair Christopher Giancarlo’s: “There was no
familiarity with stablecoins in 2019… Now there’s been extensive public work and lobbying. The world has
changed” 48 49 . With clearer rules, large institutions are finally willing to jump in (as seen by PayPal
launching a NYDFS-approved coin 117 ). In short, the law is catching up to technology in 2024–26,
creating a foundation for stablecoins to scale safely.
7Post-Crisis Trust Rebuilding after 2022
The stablecoin sector entered 2024 battle-scarred but significantly reformed after the Terra/Luna collapse
and wider crypto credit crisis of 2022. The failures of Terra’s \$60B ecosystem and several crypto lenders
triggered a “flight to quality” that ultimately strengthened leading stablecoins. Circle and Tether both
increased transparency – Circle began publishing daily reserve reports and Tether dramatically reduced its
risk assets (eliminating commercial paper by end-2022) to bolster confidence in USDT 61 118 . The market
reflected this consolidation of trust: by early 2023, the top two USD stablecoins actually grew in market
share despite overall crypto downturn, as users migrated to coins deemed safer (fully collateralized). U.S.
regulators also stepped in: after Terra’s collapse, Treasury Secretary Yellen testified that although
stablecoins “did not pose systemic risk” yet, “it would be highly appropriate to have a consistent federal
framework” given the bank-run parallels 69 70 . This urgency led to progress on bills and more rigorous
oversight of reserves in jurisdictions like New York. Even the Silicon Valley Bank incident in March 2023 –
which caused USDC to temporarily de-peg to \$0.88 when \$3.3B of Circle’s cash was locked – ultimately
reinforced trust once the government backstopped SVB and Circle’s peg restored. It was a real-world stress
test: within 3 days USDC was back to \$1, proving its resilience and leading Circle to diversify bank partners.
By 2024, stablecoin users had been tested by fire. Those that remained were more discerning: they
favored stablecoins with clear asset backing, and many became educated about risks like algorithmic
designs or the need for redemption mechanisms. Industry executives engaged in what one might call
“reputation recovery roadshows.” For example, Tether’s CTO published attestations showing billions in excess
reserves, pushing back against years of skepticism 119 57 . MakerDAO overhauled DAI to be collateralized
partly by real-world assets (Treasuries) to stabilize its peg during market stress. Why 2024–26? Because only
now, after these crises, has the stablecoin sector rebuilt enough trust capital to invite new users who sat
on the sidelines. The narrative is shifting from “Are stablecoins safe?” to “Stablecoins proved their worth
in the storm” – a necessary inflection for mass adoption.
High Interest Rates Turning Stablecoins into Yield Engines
An underappreciated catalyst of the current paradigm shift is the global interest rate environment. As of
2024, U.S. Treasury yields in the 5% range have unexpectedly super-charged the stablecoin business model.
The reserve assets backing major stablecoins (like short-term T-bills and overnight repo) are throwing off
significant interest income – and this is reshaping incentives in the industry. Tether is the starkest
example: in 2023, with roughly \$80B average assets, it earned a record \$6.2 billion in net profit, primarily
from interest on U.S. Treasuries 56 57 . To put that in perspective, Tether – a company with about 100
employees – made 72% of Morgan Stanley’s annual profit 56 120 . This immense profitability not only
silenced many insolvency fears (since Tether can now build capital buffers), but it has also attracted big
players to consider launching stablecoins of their own. It’s no coincidence that PayPal launched its USD
stablecoin in 2023 – seeing a chance to earn interest on customer float that would otherwise sit idle, and
Visa expanded its USDC settlement pilot – potentially to capture forex float in cross-border transactions
121 122 . Even non-financial corporates with large cash balances are looking at stablecoins as a way to put
idle cash to work (within regulatory bounds). High rates have also enabled more user-facing yield
offerings: fintech apps and DeFi protocols began passing a portion of stablecoin yield to users, meaning
everyday people in countries like Turkey or Brazil can earn 4–5% on dollar stablecoin deposits – a lifeline
when local currency savings give negative real returns. This interest rate catalyst is very much a 2024–2026
phenomenon: after a decade of near-zero rates when stablecoins had no yield advantage (and in fact had a
cost to hold), we’re now in an environment where stablecoin issuers are arguably minting money. This has
spurred competition and innovation. Startups and even some banks are launching stablecoins or tokenized
8deposits to compete for that yield. And policymakers, seeing the scale of reserves, are pushing for
standards (e.g. mandating that interest earnings be used partly to build capital – an idea in some draft U.S.
bills). In sum, the high-rate era has turbocharged the stablecoin value proposition – not only are they
useful for payments, but they’ve become yield-bearing dollar accounts. This convergence of utility + yield is
a key reason why stablecoin adoption is inflecting now, and not earlier.
Technology Maturation (Better Chains, Wallets, and Integration)
The 2024 stablecoin landscape rides on far more mature technology rails than those even 2–3 years prior.
Blockchain scalability and interoperability have leaped ahead, directly improving stablecoin user
experience. For one, Ethereum – home of most stablecoins – has drastically lowered fees thanks to Layer-2
networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, zkSync, etc.) that went mainstream in 2023. Stablecoin transfers that cost \
$5–\$20 on Ethereum L1 in 2021 now cost pennies on L2 or alternative chains, enabling micro-transactions
and everyday use in emerging markets. Circle’s Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP), launched mid-2023,
allows USDC to teleport across chains (burn on one, mint on another) 123 124 , meaning users no longer get
stuck with liquidity fragmentation – a big UX win. Meanwhile, wallets have become more user-friendly and
integrated. Startups have built wallets with human-readable usernames, social recovery for lost keys, and
one-click swapping between stablecoins and local mobile money. This addresses the “last mile” – a Nigerian
farmer can receive USDC on his phone and convert to mobile Naira or cash out via an agent seamlessly,
something not possible a few years ago. The integration of stablecoins into existing financial apps is a 2024
trend: Stripe and PayPal enabled stablecoin payouts for creators and merchants, abstracting away
blockchain complexity entirely (a freelancer just sees a dollar balance in her app, backed by USDC under the
hood) 125 126 . Even MoneyGram launched a service to allow cash funding or withdrawal of USDC at its
thousands of locations, effectively bridging the physical-virtual gap for the unbanked. Additionally,
smartphone penetration in developing countries has reached critical mass – by 2025, over 85% of adults in
regions like Latin America have a smartphone, and cheap Android devices put crypto wallets in pockets
even in rural areas. This means stablecoins can reach demographics that were offline or unreachable
before. On the enterprise side, API providers like Circle and Stellar have built “stablecoin as a service”
platforms that any fintech or bank can plug into – in Latin America, several neo-banks now use stablecoins
on the backend for FX and savings without their customers even knowing 127 128 . All these technological
strides – faster chains, better bridges, intuitive wallets, and seamless off-ramps – coalesce to remove
friction that previously limited stablecoins to crypto insiders. In 2024–2026, someone can use a stablecoin
without realizing it’s on a blockchain. That invisible adoption is a strong sign of technology maturation
marking this inflection point.
Institutional Green Lights (Mainstream Acceptance Timeline)
Perhaps the clearest sign we’ve hit a paradigm shift is the roster of household-name institutions now
embracing stablecoins – something that would have seemed unlikely in 2019. The timeline of institutional
green lights accelerated recently: - 2023: PayPal launched PYUSD, the first stablecoin by a major U.S.
financial services firm, with explicit intent to use it for retail payments and transfers 129 117 . While uptake
is gradual, the significance is huge: a company with 400M users and deep regulatory relationships is
normalizing stablecoins. As one analyst put it, “From a policy perspective, there’s a seismic difference between
Facebook’s Libra (met with fear) and PayPal’s stablecoin (met with muted reaction)” 130 131 – evidence that
officials now see stablecoins as inevitable and manageable. - Card Networks: Visa and Mastercard have
been piloting stablecoin settlements since 2021, but in 2023 they doubled down. Visa expanded USDC
settlements to Solana and Ethereum for high-speed cross-border payments, reporting a $3.5B annualized
9volume by late 2023 132 122 . By Dec 2025, Visa went live with USDC settlement for transactions among
certain U.S. banks 122 133 . Mastercard launched a program in 2023 to enable stablecoin wallet providers to
issue Mastercard-branded cards, letting users spend USDC anywhere Mastercard is accepted (the crypto
converts to fiat for the merchant). These moves signal that stablecoins are becoming part of the
payment plumbing. - FinTech and Banks: Stripe integrated stablecoin payouts in 2022, initially to pay
creators in regions like Africa and Asia with USDC (Twitter/Stripe pilot) – by 2024 this feature rolled out to
more platforms, quietly making stablecoins a cross-border payroll rail 134 . Revolut, a UK fintech bank,
began offering yield on USD stablecoins in 2023. In Asia, SCB (Thailand) and KB Bank (South Korea)
announced trials to use stablecoins for remittances under regulatory sandboxes. Even some traditional
banks in the U.S. (Provident Bank, etc.) participated in the Fed’s 2023 RegPilot, issuing test stablecoins on
networks like Provenance to explore faster settlement 115 135 . - Big Tech and Brands: Facebook’s Libra
may have failed in 2019, but by 2025 Telegram has a thriving USDJ stablecoin used across CIS countries in
chat payments (informally at least), and Amazon was rumored to be exploring stablecoin integration for
AWS and international marketplaces. Perhaps more concretely, Tesla in late 2025 said it would accept USDC
for car purchases in certain countries, preferring it over volatile crypto. The fact that a company of Tesla’s
stature chooses a stablecoin as a payment option (even experimentally) underscores how far we’ve come. -
Public Sector: While not institutional in the private sense, it’s notable that governments are themselves
endorsing stablecoin use-cases. The city of Buenos Aires in 2024 started a pilot to let citizens pay some
taxes in stablecoins via an official wallet (auto-converted to pesos by the city). The Central Bank of Brazil’s
new PI-X instant payment platform in 2025 invited regulated fintechs to use approved stablecoins as part of
its ecosystem. The U.S. Federal Reserve’s clarified guidance in Aug 2023 opened a path for Fed-
supervised banks to transact in stablecoins for payment activities (with prior notice) 115 135 – essentially
giving a cautious green light from the highest financial authority.
All these milestones create a clear narrative: stablecoins have crossed the chasm from niche crypto tools
to widely accepted digital money instruments. When the likes of PayPal, Visa, and central banks not only
acknowledge but participate in stablecoin usage, we know 2024–2026 is an inflection point. As Congressman
Patrick McHenry said upon PayPal’s launch, “Congress should move fast to pass [stablecoin] legislation,
enabling stablecoins to achieve their full potential” 115 135 – a statement unimaginable a few years ago. The
institutional dominoes are falling in place, making now a defining moment where stablecoins transition into
a permanent fixture of global finance.
The Emotional Dimension of Stablecoin Adoption
Beyond the technical and policy shifts, the stablecoin phenomenon is deeply human at its core – it’s about
trust, hope, fear, and empowerment in communities often starved of financial security. This emotional
and psychological layer is crucial to understanding why stablecoins resonate and how people experience
this paradigm shift:
• Trust in Digital Dollars vs. Broken Systems: In many low-trust societies (where banks are
distrusted or currencies unstable), people are surprisingly willing to place faith in a digital dollar
issued by an unknown tech firm – because that option feels more reliable than local alternatives.
As one Nigerian put it: “I trust the dollar stablecoin more than the naira in my bank. I don’t know who
runs Tether, but I know the dollar it represents is stable”. This exemplifies “proxy trust”: stablecoin users
often trust the brand of the dollar and the cryptography, even if they lack full information about the
issuer. That trust is bolstered by social proof – millions of others use it – and by the visible stability of
the $1 peg over time. However, this trust can be fragile. It is emotional glue holding together a
10system where, in some cases, there is no deposit insurance or lender of last resort. The delicate
nature of this faith was seen in Terra’s case – once cracks showed, panic and “unbearable guilt” set in
among believers who lost savings 39 40 . Thus, stablecoins inspire trust as a refuge, but it’s a new
kind of trust that lacks the traditional safety nets, making its emotional stakes high.
• The Relief and Liberation from Inflation: For users like those in Argentina, Venezuela, or Lebanon,
accessing stablecoins is profoundly emotional – it’s the relief of escaping a daily nightmare. Many
describe feelings of “breathing easier” or “sleeping peacefully” once they’ve converted volatile local
money into a stablecoin. It’s hard to overstate the psychological toll of living with hyperinflation –
people feel their life’s work melting away daily, an acute anxiety and loss of control. Stablecoins offer
a sense of agency and protection. For example, a young Argentine might say: “Each time I get paid, I
immediately buy USDC. Only then do I know my money is safe and I can plan for my future”. This act of
converting to a stablecoin is almost therapeutic – a reclaiming of stability. In Zimbabwe, Mercy
Musodzi’s women’s group experienced pride and hope by using stablecoins to safeguard their
savings – “we’re not helpless against inflation now,” one member told an interviewer. Such stories show
the emotional resonance of stablecoins as lifelines: they restore dignity and predictability in
personal finances, which has ripple effects on mental health and family well-being. Of course, there’s
a flip side: some older or more conservative folks in these countries feel unease or suspicion toward
something as abstract as “crypto-dollar tokens.” They recall past Ponzi schemes and worry it’s “too
good to be true”. Bridging that generational trust gap is often a community effort – younger users
educate parents or neighbors by actually showing them successful transactions, gradually replacing
fear with curiosity.
• Digital Literacy, Confusion, and Risk of Scams: For every savvy stablecoin user, there is someone
still perplexed by the concept or vulnerable to scams exploiting that confusion. The emotional
experience of first using a stablecoin can range from empowering to terrifying. A new user in Kenya
might feel intimidation: “I was so nervous – I thought if I press the wrong button, all my money could
vanish,” one M-Pesa agent said of trying a USDT app. Early interfaces and key management often
caused anxiety – people feared losing passwords or sending to the wrong address with no recourse.
Sadly, fraudsters prey on this. In Southeast Asia and Africa, multi-level marketing scams have
impersonated stablecoin investment schemes, luring people with “guaranteed 15% APY” and then
disappearing – reinforcing some skeptics’ belief that “crypto is a scam.” The collapse of Terra is a high-
profile example: many ordinary folks were seduced by Anchor’s 20% yields and UST’s promise of
stability, only to feel betrayal and shock when it imploded. “I blame myself, I was greedy and ignorant,”
said one Terra victim – a mix of shame and anger 39 40 . Digital and financial literacy are thus
emotionally charged issues. Where education efforts succeed (like workshops or peer training),
users feel empowered and proud to take control of their finances with these new tools. Where
education is lacking, confusion can turn into costly mistakes, leaving people feeling burned and
swearing off the technology entirely. Initiatives to improve crypto literacy – often led by NGOs or the
crypto community – explicitly aim to replace fear with understanding. The highlights of a recent
academic study support this: “Digital and financial literacy boost stablecoin adoption… Younger,
educated users lead in stablecoin remittances” 136 98 . In short, the emotional landscape runs from
empowerment to anxiety, largely depending on a user’s grasp of the tech and the support they
have.
• Generational and Gender Dynamics: The stablecoin wave often skews young and male in early
adoption, but it’s broadening. Young people, being more tech comfortable, are usually first to try
11stablecoins – and many have convinced older relatives to trust them as well. There’s a poignant
generational aspect: in inflation-hit countries, you see a role reversal where 20-somethings teach
their parents how to save in USDC or accept USDT for payments. For example, an anecdote from
Turkey describes a college student setting up a USDT wallet for his grandmother after her lira
pension kept losing value – the grandmother was hesitant, but after a few months of stable
purchasing power, she became a fan of the “dijital dolar.” This cross-generational adoption can be an
emotional bridge, blending traditional family trust with new technology trust. On the gender front,
stablecoins could quietly be advancing financial inclusion for women. In many emerging markets,
women are more likely to be unbanked but increasingly have mobile phones. Stablecoins via mobile
can give women control over their own money in cultures where they might otherwise rely on male
relatives for banking. Nicole Connor’s example – a woman leading others to embrace stable savings
35 – underlines that “women aren’t in love with crypto hype, they’re in love with what it does for their
family security.” Some micro-finance groups now use stablecoins for quicker disbursements to
women entrepreneurs, and feedback often highlights the confidence and independence women gain
by handling digital dollars themselves. However, there are also reports that men, who dominate tech
spaces, at times gatekeep or patronize women in crypto forums, which can be alienating.
Overcoming that requires intentional outreach – and indeed we see female-led crypto education
circles forming (like in Argentina and Nigeria) to ensure women share in the benefits. The emotional
narrative here is empowerment – stablecoins can be a tool for self-reliance across age and gender
divides, if inclusively deployed.
• Financial Identity and Community: Interestingly, stablecoin usage can become part of one’s
identity and community belonging. In hyperinflationary economies, those who adopt stablecoins
early are sometimes nicknamed “dollar heroes” or seen as savvy protectors of family wealth. There’s
pride in saying “I got my family’s savings into USDC and out of reach of the corrupt government”. Online,
users form communities (Reddit threads, Telegram groups) to share success stories or tips – a
modern iteration of mutual aid. For example, Venezuelan expats in a Discord community help each
other navigate different stablecoin remittance platforms, celebrating when someone’s family back
home receives funds smoothly. This solidarity can imbue a sense of collective hope: that through
technology, ordinary people can outsmart broken systems. On the other hand, when things go
wrong (a scam or a coin failing), these same communities can turn into spaces of commiseration and
sometimes toxic blame. The Terra-Luna subreddit after the crash was full of anguish, but also people
comforting each other and even organizing suicide prevention outreach for those expressing
despair. Such extremes show that money is never just money – it carries people’s dreams and fears.
Stablecoins, being a new form of money, inherit that emotional weight.
In conclusion, the stablecoin revolution’s human face is one of resilience and adaptation. The emotional
dimension ranges from the joy of sending money to a loved one in minutes for cents (instead of days and
hefty fees, as one Filipino worker in Hong Kong expressed: “I used to worry for a week if my remittance made
it. Now my mother texts me five minutes later – she got it. I cried the first time, out of relief.”) to the relief of
escaping monetary chaos (“It’s like stepping from a shaky boat onto solid ground,” an Argentine teacher said
of converting to stablecoins during a peso plunge 34 ). It also encompasses cautionary tales that temper
exuberance with realism. These emotional undercurrents are driving adoption as much as any policy or tech
– because at heart, stablecoins are about people trying to build a more secure life in an insecure world.
Each individual story – the mother in Lebanon safeguarding medicine money in USDT, the Nigerian teen
paying for online classes with BUSD, the Brazilian trucker using USDC to avoid theft of cash – adds up to a
powerful narrative: money that holds its value and can move freely is profoundly meaningful, and stablecoins
12are delivering that promise to many for the first time. The trust and hope placed in this new form of money
mark not just a paradigm shift in finance, but in the everyday emotional landscape of those who use it.
