# Deep Research Report 5: "The Gaps"
# Real Economy vs Trading Volume, Rate Sensitivity, Tax Barriers, Tron Governance, Insurance, and a Real Sarah

You are conducting deep research for a book about the global stablecoin paradigm shift. Four previous research rounds have covered: (1) human stories, user voices, "why now" structural argument; (2) geopolitics, country arcs, economic displacement; (3) frontier use cases, philosophical/theoretical grounding, monetary theory; (4) gaming, AI, micropayments, developed-world stake.

This fifth and final research round fills specific gaps identified during plan review — topics where the book makes claims or builds arguments without sufficient data. Each gap corresponds to a steel-man argument or structural weakness that, if left unaddressed, would undermine the book's credibility with sophisticated readers.

This round has three queries (A, B, C). Each can be researched independently.

## QUERY A: THE REAL ECONOMY QUESTION, RATE SENSITIVITY, AND DEPOSIT PROTECTION

### A1: How Much Stablecoin Volume is "Real Economy" vs Crypto Trading?

The book claims stablecoins processed $27.6T in 2024, exceeding Visa+Mastercard combined. Critics argue ~88% of that volume is crypto trading (exchange-to-exchange arbitrage, DeFi recycling, market-making), NOT real-world commerce. I need data to engage with this honestly.

**Research needed:**

- What is the best available breakdown of stablecoin transaction volume by use case? Categories: (a) crypto exchange trading/arbitrage, (b) DeFi protocol interactions (lending, swaps, yield farming), (c) remittances, (d) B2B cross-border payments, (e) merchant/retail payments, (f) payroll, (g) other real-economy.
- Track this breakdown over time: 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, H1 2025. Is the real-economy share growing? At what rate?
- Sources to prioritize: Chainalysis "Geography of Cryptocurrency" reports, Visa stablecoin data reports, Circle "State of USDC" transparency reports, Brevan Howard Digital analysis, a16z "State of Crypto" annual report, Castle Island Ventures / Nic Carter analyses.
- The "retail transaction count" argument: retail transactions (<$10K) are <2% of volume by VALUE but what share by TRANSACTION COUNT? If 60% of transactions are retail by count, the grassroots adoption story holds even if the VALUE is dominated by institutions.
- Are there any studies that specifically separate "organic" stablecoin usage (someone paying for goods, sending remittance) from "financial plumbing" (market makers cycling)?
- MoneyGram, Stripe, PayPal stablecoin-specific volume numbers — any published? These are pure real-economy flows.
- What does the trend line look like? The key argument is: early internet traffic was overwhelmingly academic/military before commercial use exploded. Is the same pattern visible in stablecoins?

### A2: Interest Rate Sensitivity — What Happens When Rates Drop?

Tether earned ~$9-10B in interest income at 5% rates in 2024-2025, making it one of the most profitable entities in crypto. The key unanswered question: what happens to the ecosystem at 1% yields?

**Research needed:**

- Has anyone published projections of stablecoin issuer economics at 3%, 1%, or 0.5% rates? Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg Intelligence, Goldman Sachs crypto research, or academic papers?
- Tether's operating cost structure: ~100 employees, but total operating costs (banking, legal, custody, compliance, blockchain ops)? What is the cost floor — at what rate does the business break even?
- Circle S-1 filing (if completed by early 2026): revenue mix breakdown — how much is interest vs transaction fees vs API fees? This tells us how rate-dependent Circle specifically is.
- Historical correlation: plot stablecoin total market cap (2017-2025) against Federal Funds Rate. Does the acceleration correlate with rate hikes (2022-23) or precede them? If growth preceded rate hikes, the utility case is independent of yield.
- At 0.5% yields, the "earn 4-5% on stablecoins" pitch to Turkish/Argentine savers disappears. But does the utility case (fast, cheap, borderless payments) still hold independently of yield? Any analysis separating yield-seeking users from utility users?
- Any statements from PayPal about whether PYUSD's business case depends on rate environment?
- Did mobile money growth (M-Pesa etc) depend on interest rates? M-Pesa thrived in near-zero rate environments — useful if the parallel holds.

### A3: Stablecoin Insurance and Deposit Protection — The Missing Safety Net

If stablecoins replace bank accounts for hundreds of millions, what replaces FDIC/FSCS-style deposit insurance? This is the most practical question a mainstream reader will ask.

**Research needed:**

- GENIUS Act specifics on reserve protection: what exactly are the "bankruptcy-remote" reserve structures in the legislation? How do they work legally? Is this equivalent to deposit insurance or structurally different?
- FDIC pass-through insurance: some fintech banks reportedly offer FDIC coverage for stablecoins held in custodial accounts through partner banks. Which ones? What are the limits? How does it work in practice?
- Has any country proposed government-backed insurance specifically for stablecoin deposits? Any academic papers proposing such a framework?
- Surveys asking stablecoin users whether they know their deposits are uninsured. Do they understand the risk? (FIS consumer survey, Deloitte crypto survey, Chainalysis user research, etc.)
- Circle's custodial setup: BNY Mellon custody, BlackRock managing reserves — is this functionally as safe as FDIC, even without the label? Any analysis comparing this to traditional deposit insurance?
- Are Nexus Mutual, InsurAce, etc. still active and growing as of 2025-2026? Total coverage written for stablecoin-specific risk? Any claims paid for depegs specifically?

## QUERY B: A REAL SARAH AND THE TAX BARRIER

### B1: Finding a Real Developed-World Stablecoin User

The book has four through-line characters. Three are real people with published stories: Femi (Cambridge African Studies Review, 2025), Pablo Toro (Al Jazeera/Reuters, 2021), Mercy Musodzi (Celo case study). The fourth — "Sarah," a US freelance designer — is a composite. She needs to be replaced with a real, named person.

**Research needed:**

Find a real, named, published freelancer, gig worker, or small business owner in the US, UK, or EU who uses stablecoin payments for their professional work. Requirements:

- Must have a published interview, profile, blog post, case study, podcast appearance, or social media thread describing their experience
- Must include their real name (or a clearly attributable pseudonym used consistently)
- Must include specific details: what they use (USDC, USDT, DAI), how they receive payments, from which countries, cost savings vs traditional methods, friction points
- Ideally includes direct quotes about their experience
- Should represent the developed-world reader — someone whose problems (PayPal fees, ACH delays, FX markups, invoice chasing) resonate with American, British, or European readers

**Places to look:**

- Bitwage blog / case studies / user profiles (they specialize in crypto payroll)
- Request Finance case studies (invoicing platform using crypto)
- Deel or Remote.com case studies mentioning stablecoin/crypto payouts
- Coinbase Commerce merchant stories
- Circle blog / USDC case studies featuring individual users or small businesses
- Superfluid or Sablier (streaming payments) user stories
- Podcasts: "Bankless," "The Defiant," "Unchained" — search for episodes featuring freelancers or small business owners discussing stablecoin payments
- Twitter/X threads: freelancers sharing their experience receiving USDC from international clients
- Reddit r/cryptocurrency, r/freelance, r/digitalnomad threads about getting paid in stablecoins
- Medium / Substack posts by individuals describing their stablecoin payroll experience
- YouTube creators who document their crypto freelancing workflow
- Shopify merchant communities discussing stablecoin checkout plugins
- Conference talks (ETHDenver, Consensus, Token2049) by freelancers or small businesses using stablecoins

If no single perfect match exists, find 2-3 real people whose stories can be composited with full transparency (e.g., "Sarah's story draws from real experiences of [Name A], a designer in Austin who receives USDC via Coinbase Commerce, and [Name B], a developer in London who invoices clients in DAI through Request Finance").

**The key narrative we need from this person:**
- International clients were a headache (PayPal fees, wire delays, FX markups, "your country isn't supported")
- Discovered stablecoin payments (how? through what platform?)
- The experience: faster, cheaper, but also — tax complexity, client hesitancy, the learning curve
- The emotional arc: frustration → discovery → adoption → ongoing friction (taxes, explaining it to clients) → net positive
- A quotable line that captures the developed-world value proposition

### B2: The Tax Barrier — Comprehensive Treatment

Stablecoin taxation is the #1 practical barrier for developed-world adoption. The book needs a clear, current picture.

**Research needed:**

**United States:**
- Is a USDC-to-USD conversion a taxable event under current IRS guidance? What about USDC-to-USDT?
- IRS Notice 2014-21: how does "property" classification affect stablecoin transactions?
- De minimis exemption proposals: has Congress proposed treating stablecoin-to-USD conversions below a threshold (e.g., $200 or $600) as non-taxable? Status of any such bills?
- "Virtual Currency Tax Fairness Act" or similar legislation — status?
- Foreign currency treatment proposals: any bills proposing that USD-pegged stablecoins be treated as foreign currency (which has a de minimis exemption)?
- IRS enforcement: any specific enforcement actions targeting stablecoin tax evasion? Summons to exchanges for stablecoin transaction data?
- Form 1040 crypto question: does it specifically mention stablecoins? How are taxpayers supposed to report stablecoin-to-stablecoin swaps?
- Crypto tax software: which platforms handle stablecoin transactions well? (CoinTracker, Koinly, TokenTax, TurboTax integration)

**European Union:**
- DAC8 directive: what does it require for stablecoin transaction reporting? When does it take effect? How does it work?
- VAT treatment: are stablecoin transactions subject to VAT in EU member states?
- Country variation: Germany (crypto gains tax-free after 1 year hold), Portugal (until 2023 no crypto tax, now changed), France, Netherlands — how do stablecoin taxes vary?
- MiCA's interaction with taxation: does MiCA affect how stablecoins are taxed?

**Other jurisdictions:**
- UK: HMRC treatment of stablecoins. Is a stablecoin a "cryptoasset" for tax purposes? Capital gains on USDC-to-GBP?
- Singapore: no capital gains tax — does this apply to stablecoins?
- UAE: no income tax — stablecoin transactions effectively tax-free?
- Japan: high crypto tax rate (up to 55%). Does this apply to stablecoin transactions?

**The adoption barrier data:**
- Surveys or studies showing tax complexity as a reason for NOT adopting stablecoin payments. Deloitte, PwC, EY crypto surveys. Any US freelancer surveys mentioning crypto tax burden?
- Estimated compliance cost: how much does it cost (in time and money) for a US freelancer receiving 50 USDC payments/year to properly report taxes? Vs 50 PayPal payments?
- The GENIUS Act: does it include any tax simplification for stablecoin transactions? If not, is companion legislation expected?

---

## QUERY C: TRON GOVERNANCE AND JUSTIN SUN

50%+ of all USDT runs on Tron, processing ~$24.6B in daily transfers. This is arguably the most underappreciated systemic risk in the stablecoin ecosystem. The book needs a governance deep dive.

### C1: Who Controls Tron?

**Research needed:**

**Governance specifics:**
- Who are the 27 Super Representatives? Can they be identified by name or organization? Any published lists?
- What is the voter turnout for SR elections? What percentage of TRX holders actually participate?
- Is there evidence of SR concentration — do a small number of entities (or Sun-affiliated entities) control multiple SR slots? Any blockchain governance research on this?
- What specific powers do SRs have? Can they theoretically censor specific transactions or addresses? Has this ever been discussed or tested?

**Justin Sun's current legal and regulatory status (as of early 2026):**
- SEC charges against Sun: what were the specific allegations? What was the outcome (settlement, ongoing, dismissed)?
- Any other regulatory proceedings (Hong Kong, South Korea, other jurisdictions)?
- His involvement with HTX (formerly Huobi) and the Poloniex hack — current status?
- Is Sun formally distanced from Tron governance, or does he maintain effective control? What's the corporate structure vs reality?
- If Sun were personally sanctioned by OFAC, what would the legal implications be for Tron-based USDT?

**USDT chain migration trends:**
- Is Tron's 50%+ share of USDT stable, growing, or declining? Monthly data from 2022-2025 if available.
- Which chains are gaining USDT share? Ethereum L2s? Solana?
- Has Tether ever commented on Tron dependency risk or diversification strategy?
- Has there ever been a governance incident, network outage, or consensus controversy on Tron? Any published risk assessments from Chainalysis, academics, or regulators?
